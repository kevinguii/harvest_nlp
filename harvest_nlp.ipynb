countries issued the Dublin Declaration on \\nPartnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and central  Asia. One of its actions called on the European Union and \\nother relevant regional institutions and organ isation s, in partnership with the Joint UN Programme on HIV and \\nAIDS (UNAIDS), to establish forums and mechanisms to closely monitor and evaluate the implementation of the \\nDeclaration’s actions . This report provides a brief summary of findings from a review of progres s made towards  \\nimplementing the Dublin Declaration. It is based on data from 49 countries and reflects the contributions of a wide range of individuals and organ isation s. \\nPolitical leadership and partnership  \\nHIV is a political priority for the European Un ion and countries of Europe and central  Asia. This has been  reflected \\nin a number of declarations during the past decade. The high priority given to HIV is also reflected in European \\nCommission policies and plans, including the Communication on Combating H IV/AIDS in the European Union. The \\nCommission has recently issued a follow -up Communication and accompanying Action Plan for the period 2009 –\\n2013.  \\nAt the national level, almost all countries report having a strategic framework for their response to HIV (9 2%) and \\na management/coordination body (84%). Eight countries reported that they had developed their strategic \\nframeworks in the last five years, i.e. since the Dublin Declaration. However, it is unclear whether  these generic \\nmeasures are appropriate proxi es for political leadership on HIV in the region. More appropriate measures might be:  \\n• the degree to which financial resources for HIV prevention are appropriately targeted on key populations, \\nsuch as injecting drug users ( IDU), men who have sex with men ( MSM) and sex workers (see Section  1.3); \\n• the extent to which countries are implementing key interventions, such as harm reduction programmes for \\nIDU (see Section  2.2) and prevention programmes for MSM (see Section  2.3) on a sufficient scale ; and  \\n• the extent to which countries have tackled difficult but essential policy issues, such as the provision of harm \\nreduction programmes for IDU in prison settings ( see Section  2.6), access to services for migrants from \\ncountries with generalised HIV epidemics (see Secti on 2.5) and creating a supportive policy environment for \\nwork with MSM (see Section  2.3). \\nIn general, there is evidence that civil society is recogn ised as an important player in the response to HIV across \\nthe region and that it  is heavily  involved in that  response. Almost all countries (98%) reported involving civil \\nsociety to some extent in developing their strategic framework. Both government and civil society reported specific benefits of including civil society in HIV responses, and civil society commented that the context for their \\ninvolvement in responses improved between 2005 and 2007. Information on involvement of the private sector in \\nresponses to HIV is more limited . \\nHIV epidemics in Europe and central  Asia are largely concentrated among specific populations. There is evidence \\nthat some countries in the region are effectively focusing their funding for prevention efforts on the most  affected \\npopulations ( see Section  1.3, Figure 5). However , doing this more would not only ensure better value for mon ey \\nbut would result in a more effective response overall. Although financing for national HIV responses in the region is \\ncoming increasingly from domestic sources, ongoing financial support for  HIV responses in the low - and middle-\\nincome countries of the r egion is likely to be needed for the foreseeable  future ( see Figure 6). Given the global \\nfinancial crisis, the increased focus on the poorest countries with the largest burden of HIV infection and the \\nincreasing focus on strengthening health systems, low - and middle- income countries in the region are concerned \\nabout the likelihood of current funding  streams (such as those from the Global Fund) to these countries being \\nsustained.  \\nThere has been an almost fivefold increase in funds available for the global response to HIV since the Dublin \\nDeclaration ( see Figure 7). Prior  to the Declaration, in 2002, resources available for the global response to HIV \\nwere $1.2  billion. These rose more than six fold to $7.7 billion in 2008. This increase has been driven by the U S and \\nseveral European countries, through both bilateral and multilateral initiatives. In 2008, 40% of all disbursements \\nfor international AIDS assistance from donor countries came from European Union M ember States, European Free \\nTrade Association  (EFTA) c ountries and the European Commission. Given the current global financial crisis and \\ncompeting priorities for funding, it could be challenging for European countries and institutions to maintain and \\nfurther increase these levels of funding.  \\nPrevention  \\nThere is strong evidence that certain key populations are particularly affected by HIV in Europe and central  Asia. It \\nis well  known that IDU ( see Section  2.2) are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection and this is certainly the c ase \\nacross the region ( see Figure 14). Evidence from many countries shows that HIV transmission among IDU can be   \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n2 \\n \\n \\n \\ncontrolled if effective services are provided on a sufficient scale to make a difference. Key measures include the \\nnumber of needles/ syringes distributed per IDU per year a nd the percentage of IDU receiving opioid substitution \\ntherapy. There is a need for all countries to aspire to the high levels of programme coverage that have already \\nbeen achieved by some.  \\nIt is well known that MSM ( see Section  2.3) have  been particularly  affected by HIV in certain countries and regions, \\nincluding parts of Europe. MSM are particularly affected by HIV not only in the western part of the region (see \\nFigure 16), but  there is also evidence that they are more affected than previously recogn ised in other parts of the \\nregion and that, in some countries, infection rates among MSM are continuing to rise. Although it is not clear how \\ncoverage of programmes for MSM  can be precisely measured , it can nevertheless be seen that coverage remains \\nlow in man y countries and rates of unprotected anal sex remain unacceptably high among some MSM. There is \\nalso evidence from some countries that particular groups of MSM –  the young, those outside capital cities, those \\nwho are less well educated and those who identi fy themselves as bisexual –  are less likely to be reached by HIV \\nprogrammes.  \\nAlthough sex workers (see Section  2.4) are seen as being particularly at risk of HIV infection globally, there is less \\nevidence that this is the case in the region. For example, H IV prevalence rates among sex workers are relatively \\nlow in many countries (see Figure  18). However, this is not true of all sex workers. Some categories of sex workers \\nhave higher rates of HIV infection, including those who also inject drugs, male and tra nsgender sex workers, those \\nfrom countries with generalised epidemics and those who work on the street. Among sex workers as a whole, reported rates of condom use during commercial sex are relatively high and probably more relevant than generic \\nmeasures of  knowledge and programme coverage.  \\nMigrants (see Section  2.5), particularly those from countries with generalised HIV epidemics, are especially \\naffected by HIV (see Figure  21). Although some countries are concerned about other groups of migrants, such as \\nthose from other European countries, there is little evidence that these groups are disproportionately affected by \\nHIV, independent of other risk behaviours such as injecting drug use. Issues relating to migrants do not only relate \\nto HIV prevention but also arise in relation to treatment and care (see Section  3.1). There are particular issues, in \\nmany countries, relating to the access of undocumented migrants to critical services, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART).  \\nPrisoners (see Section  2.6), especiall y those that inject drugs, are also highly vulnerable to HIV infection in the \\nregion. Although the same HIV services should be available in prisons as in the community, this is not the case in \\nmany countries of the region. EU/EFTA countries have demonstrat ed a strong lead in providing opioid substitution \\ntherapy  in prisons (see Figure 23), but this approach has not been taken up in many other countries of the region \\nand has not been reflected in the provision of sterile injecting equipment in prison settings (see Figure 23). \\nThe extent to which young people in general ( Section  2.7) are vulnerable to HIV infection  in countries of the region \\nproved to be a contentious issue for this review. However, it is clear that young people cannot be considered a \\nhomogen eous group in terms of HIV risk. Some are at significant risk, e.g. young IDU and young MSM and there is \\nsome evidence that programmatic responses are less able to reach these groups than older age groups. Although \\nmore than three  quarters of countries repo rted that HIV education is part of the curriculum in secondary schools, \\ncomprehensive sexual health education is not available for all young people in the region, particularly for the youngest, e.g. in primary schools.  \\nLiving with HIV  \\nAll countries with t rend data available reported an increase in the number of people on ART (see Figure 25) since \\nthe Dublin Declaration was adopted. In some countries , e.g. Estonia, Russia and Ukraine, these increases have \\nbeen considerable. However, there are concerns about  the low base from which these countries started and \\nwhether or not all those who need treatment receive it promptly. Current medical evidence indicates that all people \\nliving with HIV with a CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3 should be receiving ART. The issue is not really one of access to \\ntreatment for those who have been diagnosed as HIV -positive and have been shown to need treatment. Rather, \\nthe issue relates to late diagnosis, i.e. those who need treatment but have not yet been diagnosed. ECDC data for \\n2008 sh ow that in reporting countries more than half of those who had a CD4 count had a CD4 count of < 350 \\ncells/mm3 when diagnosed (see Figures 26 and  27). This is a  concern because these people start ART later than \\nrecommended.  \\nAlmost all countries (84%) report  that stigma and discrimination is addressed in national strategies or action \\nframeworks for HIV and AIDS, but this is not consistently reflected in policies and programmes (see Figure 30). \\nThere is also strong evidence of residual stigmatisation  and discr iminatory attitudes in countries of  the region and \\nthe extent to which available mechanisms, such as relevant laws and policies, are used to combat stigma and discrimination is unclear.  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\nMonitoring the Dublin Declaration  \\nAs mentioned above, this report embodies the commitment to monitor the implementation of the Dublin \\nDeclaration. Two of the principles followed in compiling it have been, first, using existing data and indicators \\nwherever possible and, second, ensuring that indicators being tracked are r elevant to the context of European and \\ncentral  Asian countries. At times, there has been tension between these principles, particularly over the extent to \\nwhich UNGASS indicators and data can be used for the process.  \\nUNGASS indicators have been used where ver possible. Where countries previously submitted data for UNGASS this \\nhas been used. Data was received from 12 countries that did not submit reports to UNGASS in 2008.The review \\nspecifically allowed countries to submit available data for particular topic s even if it did not correspond exactly to \\nUNGASS indicators. In addition, information has been collected for some population groups for whom there are no specific UNGASS indicators, e.g. prisoners and migrants from countries with general ised epidemics. On e of the \\nconclusions of the review is that more relevant data could be collected and higher response rates achieved if \\nUNAIDS adopted a regional approach to UNGASS reporting in Europe and central  Asia. ECDC is committed to play \\na leading role in such a regional process.  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\nBACKGROUND \\nIn 2004, high level representatives of European and central  Asian countries issued the Dublin Declaration on \\nPartnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and central  Asia. One of its actions called on the European Union and \\nother rel evant regional institutions and organisation s, in partnership with the Joint UN Programme on HIV and \\nAIDS (UNAIDS), to establish forums and mechanisms to closely monitor and evaluate the implementation of the \\nDeclaration’s actions . This report provides a brief summary of findings from a review of progress made towards  \\nimplementing the Dublin Declaration. It is based on data from 49 countries and reflects the contributions of a wide range of individuals and organ isation s. \\nThe European Commission mandated the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to monitor \\nprogress on a regular basis. This report documents progress using country -based reports, against a selected \\nnumber of indicators of relevance to the countries of the region. It uses existing data, where possible, and builds on previous work, including the first progress report\\n1\\nMethodology  , published in 2008 by the World Health Organ ization  (WHO) \\nRegional Office for Europe and UNAIDS, with funding from the German Ministry of Health. The review was conducted between November 2008 and June 2010.  \\nECDC established an advisory group, consisting mainly of country representatives, which met four times. A framework was developed based on thematic areas identified in the first progress report. A t otal of 38 indicators \\nwere identified for inclusion. Countries were requested to provide available data on these indicators using a questionnaire designed specifically for that purpose. Where countries had previously reported relevant data, e.g. to \\nthe Eur opean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) or as part of the process to monitor the \\nUN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) Declaration of Commitment, they were not asked to do this again.  \\nA training and orientation workshop was hel d at ECDC in Stockholm from 16 to 18 June 2009. This was attended \\nby representatives from 33 European and central  Asian countries. Following the workshop, tailored questionnaires \\nwere sent to 55 countries. Responses were received from 49 countries, includi ng from 12 countries that did not \\nsubmit returns to UNGASS in 2008.  \\nOverview of the HIV e pidemic in the region  \\nHIV infection remains an important public health issue in Europe, with no signs of a decrease in the overall number \\nof newly  diagnosed cases of H IV infection. Since 2000, the rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases reported has more \\nthan doubled from 44 per million population in 2000 to 89 per million in 2008, based on the 43 countries that have \\nconsistently reported HIV surveillance data during this per iod. This is particularly due to increasing infection rates \\nin the eastern part of the region.  \\nIn 20082, 51 600 newly  diagnosed cases of HIV infection were reported by 49 countries in Europe and central  \\nAsia3. The highest rates were reported from Estonia, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Portugal, Ukraine and the  \\nUnited Kingdom ( see Figure  1). In the  same year, EU/EEA countries reported 25  656 newly diagnosed cases of HIV \\ninfection4\\nIn 2008, 7  565 cases of AIDS were reported by 47 countries, with the highest rates reported by Estonia, Latvia, Portugal and the United Ki ngdom.   \\n5\\n  . While the number of AIDS cases has declined overall, \\nfrom 12  072 cases  in 2000, the number is increasing in the eastern part of the region.  \\n \\n                                                                    \\n1 WHO Regional Office for Europe/UNAIDS.

HIV/AIDS Surveillance in Europe 2008  \\nIn EU/EEA countries, the highest proportion of the total number of HIV cases w as diagnosed among  men who \\nhave sex with men (MSM) . Amo ng injecting drug users (IDU) , there seems to be a general decline in the number \\nof HIV diagnoses. However, this is still the predominant transmission mode in the Baltic countries. Despite the \\nrelatively low absolute number of cases diagnosed in these grou ps, IDU and MSM are disproportionately affected \\nby the HIV epidemic compared with the heterosexual population because of the relatively small size s of the \\npopulations and the high prevalence of HIV in these groups. Around 40% of cases of heterosexual transmission \\nwere diagnosed in individuals originating from countries with general ised epidemics who may have been infected \\noutside of Europe. These cases influence the nature of the HIV epidemics in Europe.  \\nIn countries in the centre of the region, levels of HIV remain low and stable, although there is evidence of \\nincreasing sexual (both heterosexual and homosexual) transmission in many countries. The nature of the epidemic \\nin this region is diverse, with sexual transmission among MSM dominating in some countr ies.  \\nIn countries in the east of the region, the number of HIV cases has increase d substantially . This is mainly driven by \\nan increase in cases acquired through injecting drug use. Among IDU in the east of the region, the number of \\ncases of HIV infection has increased in almost all countries.  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\n \\n \\n \\n1 LEADERSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP  \\n1.1 Political leadership:  planning and coordination  \\nStrong and effective political leadership is absolutely vital for an effective HIV response. This is particularly true in \\ncountries wh ere marginal ised populations, such as IDU ( Section  2.2), MSM ( Section  2.3), sex workers ( Section  2.4), \\nmigrants from countries with generalised epidemics ( Section  2.5) and prisoners ( Section  2.6) are disproportionately \\naffected  by HIV. So, it is important that effective political leadership can be identified and recogn ised. \\nCountries in the region score highly on international measures used to gauge political leadership. Almost all \\ncountries report having a strategic framework for their response to HIV (92% ) and a management/coordination \\nbody (84%). Several countries had developed their strategic frameworks ( eight) or introduced management/ \\ncoordination bodies ( nine) since the Dublin Declaration was made.  \\nAlmost all country frameworks (91%) were based on a needs assessment and include a clear statement of goals. \\nJust over three quarters (76%) include operational and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plans. However, less than \\nthree quarters (71%) of these frameworks have identified funding sources and less than  two thirds (62%) are \\ncosted ( see Figure 2). In general, the findings indicate that strategic frameworks have not been consistently \\ntranslated into operational plans, M&E plans and budgets.  \\nFigure  2: Percentage of countries in Europe and central  Asia repo rting particular features in their \\nstrategic framework for their national response to HIV  \\n \\nThere are similar issues with management/coordination bodies. Although almost all have terms of reference (95%), \\nactive government leadership and participation (93% ) and a functioning secretariat (88%), fewer have an action \\nplan (68%) and less than two thirds (61%) have quarterly meetings, which raises questions about the extent to \\nwhich these bodies function in practice . \\nAll but one of the responding countries had i nvolved civil society in the development of their strategic framework. \\nOver three quarters (76%) had done this fully and 22% had done this partially (see Figure  2). Similarly, almost all \\ncountries (83%) included people living with HIV (PLHIV) and civil soc iety in their management/coordination body. \\nIn contrast, the proportion (29%) of such bodies that involve the private sector is low. The high rate of \\ninvolvement of civil society in these processes and structures is positive.  \\nThe biggest question though i s about the relevance of these proxy measures of political leadership for the region \\n(see Figure 3). Given that almost all countries in the region have these frameworks  and coordinating bodies, does \\nthis mean that political leadership is equally good acros s all countries? Or does political leadership vary between  \\ncountries? If it does vary, how can strong and effective political leadership be recogn ised? Evidence from this \\nreview indicates that stronger and more discerning measures of political leadership m ight be:  \\n• the extent to which HIV prevention funding is priorit ised towards those sub- populations most  affected by  \\nHIV in a country ( see Section  1.3); \\n• the extent to which essential programmes are delivered at scale, even if, as for harm reduction programmes  \\namong IDU, they are politically contentious ; 7676716280917691\\n22\\n0 20 40 60 80 100Civil society involvementM&E planFunding sourcesCostedTargetsGoalsOperational PlanNeeds analysis\\npercentageFull\\nPartial  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n• the extent to which effective policies are in place, even if, as for non -discriminatory policies for MSM and \\nprovision of harm reduction services in prisons, they are politically contentious ; \\n• the extent to whic h countries are providing antiretroviral therapy  (ART) coverage for key populations, \\nparticularly IDU, migran ts and prisoners ( see Section  3.1). \\nThis review argues that it is by taking bold and decisive measures to control its HIV epidemic that a country \\ndemonstrates its political leadership, rather than by having a well  crafted framework and a well  constituted \\ncoordination body. This does not mean that these things are unimportant or that countries should abandon them. Rather, that they are not effective p roxy measures of political leadership.  \\nFigure  3: What is political leadership?  \\n \\n \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need to ensure that plans and structures translate into practical actions.  \\n• There is a need for countries to maintain strong political leadership in relation to their responses to HIV. In \\nparticular, they need to demonstrate the political courage to focus the response on populations most \\naffected by HIV . \\n• There is a need to consider repl acing the current indicators of political leadership used internationally with \\nothers which are more relevant to the region, more focused on actions rather than structures and policies \\nand more focused on appropriate responses to concentrated HIV epidemics, such as:  \\n− the degree to which financial resources for HIV prevention are appropriately targeted on key \\npopulations and the level of resources allocated to prevention among these populations (see Section  \\n1.3); \\n− the extent to  which countries are implementin g programmes for IDU, MSM, sex workers and \\nmigrants on a sufficient scale and these populations have access to treatment, care and support as \\nwell as to effective prevention services ( see Sections  2.2–2.5); \\n− the extent to which countries have tackled diffic ult but essential policy issues, such as the provision \\nof harm reduction programmes for IDU in prison settings (see Section  2.6); and \\n− the extent to which countries are providing ART coverage for key populations, particularly IDU, \\nmigrants and prisoners (see Section  3.1).   \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\n \\n1.2 Civil Society  \\nData presented in this chapter provide strong evidence of the perceived value of civil society organisations in national \\nresponses to HIV. Almost all (90%) countries report fully or partially involving civil society in t he development of the \\nstrategic framework for the response to HIV and AIDS. Almost all countries include civil society representatives (87%) \\nand people living with HIV (82%) on their management/coordination bodies. Almost all (88%) countries report that \\ncivil society has opportunities to influence decision -making on these bodies. Nearly two thirds (65%) of countries \\ninclude most -at-risk populations in governmental HIV policy design and programme implementation. Both \\ngovernments and civil society provided co mments on the benefits of involving civil society in national HIV responses.  \\nIn addition to issues of inclusion of civil society in management and coordination bodies for the national HIV \\nresponse, the review considered the working relationship between go vernment and civil society. Findings are based \\non civil society responses. Figure 4 shows that coordination between government and civil society more often takes \\nthe form of talking, e.g. sharing of information,  than practical actions, such as provision of  technical guidance  and \\nmaterials or commodities to support programme implementation.  \\nFigure  4: Percentage of positive responses by government showing support from AIDS \\nmanagement/coordination bodies for civil society organ isation s \\n \\nCivil society represen tatives were also asked to rank, on a scale of one (poor) to ten (good), the extent to which  \\nefforts were made to increase civil society participation in 2005 and 2007. The mean score reported by civil society \\nshowed an improvement from 5.14 in 20 05 to 6.45 in 2007.  \\nAlthough relationships are perceived to have improved, there are some common limitations across countries of the \\nregion  with regards to government and civil society partnerships. Limited access to financial and technical support \\nseriously constr ains civil society ’s capacity to contribute fully to the response. Civil society organ isation s find it \\ndifficult to get their activities included in national budgets in many countries. Further, l imited involvement of civil \\nsociety in monitoring and evaluat ion activities means that an important opportunity for review and scrutiny is \\nmissed in many countries of the region.  \\nMuch of the focus of this review, and the questions in the UNGASS National Composite Policy Index used for reporting, \\nis on civil society critique of government policies and performance. This is, of course, important. However, such a \\nreview would be stronger if it provided opportunity for an independent, balanced and constructive review of the strengths and weaknesses of civil society from a  governmental perspective. Such a review could focus on issues such \\nas governance, financial management, quality of service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation.  \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is  a need to promote partnership between government and civil society based on mutual accountability.  \\n• There is a need for all countries to involve key populations in all aspects of programmes that affect them.  \\n• In order to have a balanced perspective, there i s a need to evaluate civil society’s contributions and ability \\nto contribute to the national response, e.g. by delivering essential HIV services for most -at-risk populations.  \\n• There is a pressing need for adequate and sustainable financial support for  the work of civil society. Access \\nto financial support is critical for  effective participation by civil society in the national response to HIV. \\nSustainable funding strategies will inevitably include government sub- contracting/ grants to civil society \\norgan isations but they will also require civil society organ isation s to develop their own comprehensive \\nfundraising strategies, including exploring opportunities to for sustainable public –private partnerships.  2458738387\\n0 20 40 60 80 100Procures and distribute drugs/supplies to \\nimplementing partnersBuilds capacity of implementing partnersProvides technical guidance/materials to \\nimplementing partnersCoordinates with implementing partnersProvides information on priority needs and \\nservices to implementing partners\\npercentage  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\n \\n \\n1.3 Financial resources  \\nMore than three quarters (76%)  of countries responding were able to provide some quantitative data relating to \\ntheir expenditure on HIV prevention. When adjusted for population, per person expenditure on HIV prevention \\nranged from $0.06 in Malta to $5.81 in Luxembourg. The extent to wh ich countries’ prevention expenditure was \\nfocused on specific populations –  IDU, sex workers and MSM –  varied from 1% in Kazakhstan to 97% in the Czech \\nRepublic. Figure 5 compares these two variables and identifies four patterns.   \\nFigure  5: Comparison of p er person expenditure on HIV prevention and percentage of prevention \\nexpenditure focused on IDU, sex workers and MSM by European and central  Asian countries  \\n \\nAlthough it has been suggested that the percentage of funds from domestic resources can be used to assess political comm itment to the response, Figure 6 shows that this is largely related to a country’s wealth. However, \\nthere are some outliers, e.g. Croatia and Azerbaijan. The most significant external funder of HIV responses in the region is the Glo bal Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. In the years for which data was reported, the Global Fund \\nwas providing more than one third of the funding to national HIV responses in eight of the countries reporting to \\nUNGASS 2008.  \\n 0102030405060708090100\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6% of HIV prevention expenditure focused on IDUs, sex workers and MSM\\nPer person expenditure on HIV prevention ($)Czech Republic\\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\\nPoland\\nEstonia\\nMoldova\\nKazakhstanLow expenditure\\nHigh focus\\nHigh expenditure\\nLow focusHigh expenditure\\nHigh focus\\nLow expenditure\\nLow focus  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  6: A comparison of per centage of resources for the national HIV response from domestic \\nresources compared with  gross national income  per capita among European and central  Asian \\ncountries reporting to UNGASS 2008 (Switzerland excluded)  \\n \\n \\nSince the UNGASS Declaration of Com mitment in 2001, there has been an increase in disbursements from donor \\ncountries as internation al AIDS assistance (see Figure 7).

In 2008, 40% of all disbursements for international AIDS assistance from donor countries came from EU \\nMember States, EFTA countries and the European Commission . Of this, over three quarters (79%) came from fou r \\nMember States: France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Other significant donors included \\nNorway, Sweden, Italy, Ireland and the European Commission . \\nIn addition, European countries have been significant funders of major international ins titutions in the response to \\nHIV. For example, HIV -related contributions from Europe to the Global Fund rose from $297  million  in 2001/ 02 to \\nexceed $1  billion in 2008 (see Figure 8).  \\nFigure  8: HIV -related contributions by countries to the Global Fund , by origin , 2001– 08  \\n \\nSource: Global Fund, 2009  \\nThe majority of contributions to the Global Fund (84.3%) and to the Joint UN Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) (83%) \\ncome from EU M ember States.

Suggested reasons for the \\nreductions in European funding for vaccine and microbicide research and development since 2006/ 07 include the \\nbeginnings of an escalating eco nomic downturn, shifting of funding away from HIV and AIDS, cyclical funding for \\nprojects or an adjustment in scientific priorities. The latter explanation relates to a number of trials that released \\nresults in 2007 and 2008 which were considered disappoin ting. \\nFigure  11: European funding to vaccine and microbicide research and development , 2000- 08  \\n \\nSource: HIV Vaccines and Microbicides Resource Tracking Working Group, 2009  \\n  19.116.910.38.24.84.64.62.72.71.81.61.11.90.918.7\\nNetherlandsSwedenNorwayUnited KingdomDenmarkIrelandFinlandLuxembourgSpainBelgiumSwitzerlandGermanyOther EU/EFTAOther EuropeNon-Europe\\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0\\npercentage\\n0102030405060708090\\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008US$ (millions)\\nyearVaccine R&D\\nMicrobicide R&D  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need for countries to increase funding for their responses to HIV from domestic resources. \\nHowever, there is an ongoing need for external financial support for responses to HIV in low - and middle -\\nincome countries in the region. To date much of t his funding has come from European countries through \\nthe Global Fund. A clear strategy is needed for ensuring the sustainability of future financing.  \\n• There is a need for countries to focus HIV prevention spending on those key populations most affected by \\nHIV. This would result in a more effective HIV response and efficiency savings, i.e. services being delivered \\nat a lower overall cost.  \\n• There is a need for the countries of Europe and central  Asia to agree a common approach for monitoring \\nHIV-related expenditure. This could involve a thorough review of the National AIDS Spending Assessment \\napproach to identify what changes would make it more applicable for the regional context.  \\n• There is a need to further demonstrate European leadership through funding for  the global HIV response. \\nAll European countries could seek to emulate the example of the relatively few EU/EFTA countries that have \\nbeen spearheading this financing.  \\n• There is a need to review European financing for microbicide and vaccine research. Questions that need to \\nbe addressed  include whether such research should continue to be funded, whether  funding should be \\nreoriented or further scaled back.    \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\n \\n \\n2 PREVENTION  \\n2.1 HIV prevention: an overview  \\nThe Dublin Declaration takes a strong position on prevention o f HIV, stating that prevention ‘ must be the mainstay \\nof the sub- national, national, regional and international response to the epidemic .’ It also acknowledges the \\nimportance of ensuring universal and equitable access to HIV prevention. In a section on prev ention, the \\ndeclaration identifies a number of actions, ranging from scaled- up harm reduction services for injecting drug users \\nto access to enhanced surveillance; from reduced incidence and prevalence of sexually  transmitted infections to \\nbroad access to information, services and commodities by most -at-risk populations.   \\nGovernments and civil society clearly recogn ise the importance of prevention in their countries’ responses, \\nalthough perceptions vary on the extent to which prevention programmes are being  implemented effectively. In \\ngeneral, countries recogn ise the importance of providing prevention services for  key populations. However, \\ndifficulties in focusing prevention on key populations have been identified in a considerable number of countries.  \\nFirst, more than half (54%) of countries report having laws, regulations or policies that present obstacles to \\neffective HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for key populations. These obstacles are particularly \\ncommonly  identified for injecting drug use rs (64%), prisoners (56%) a nd migrants (48%) (see Figure 12). \\nUnfortunately, these populations are marginal ised and stigmat ised in many countries and may lack champions in \\ngovernment who are willing to work to address these obstacles.  \\nFigure  12: Percentag e of countries reporting legal, regulatory and policy barriers for specified \\npopulations to access HIV prevention, treatment, care and support (n=25)  \\n \\nSecond, it is of concern that policies/strategies that are more likely to be politically acceptable, suc h as provision of \\ninformation , are in place in more countries than those that are more challenging politically, such as provision of \\nharm reduction services for prisoners.  \\nThird, it is of particular concern that implementation of activities shows a similar  pattern to that seen regarding the \\navailability of policies and strategies, i.e. those interventions that are politically more acceptable, such as  provision \\nof safe blood , are more likely to be implemented than those that are more challenging, such as  harm reduction \\nservices for prisoners (see Figure  13). \\n  488162832485664\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100UninsuredWomenPeople living with HIV/AIDSMen who have sex with menYoung peopleSex workersMigrantsPrisonersInjecting drug users\\npercentage  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  13: Percentage of countries reporting that particular prevention services are available to the \\nmajority of those in need: Government and civil society responses  \\n \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identifi ed the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need for countries to maintain and expand their focus on key populations affected by HIV, e.g. \\ninjecting drug users, men who have sex with men, migrants from countries with general ised epidemics,  and \\nprisoners. This requires strong political leadership to ensure that evidence- based policies and programmes \\nare developed and implemented ( see Section  1.1) and to remove laws, regulations and policies that present \\nobstacles to effective prevention, treatment, care and support for these populations.  \\n• There is a need to ensure that policies and strategies are translated into decisive action through the \\nimplementation of prevention programmes, particularly those programmes focused on key populations. \\nWhile policies and strategies are a fundamental component of the response, the availability of and access to \\nprevention services based on those policies/strategies is critical if the response is going to have significant \\nimpact on the transmission of HIV. It is essential that key services are delivered on a  sufficient scale to \\nmake a difference.  \\n• There is a need for countries to resist political pressure to divert limited prevention resources to spending on activities for populations at significantly lower risk of  HIV infection and to ensure that spending is \\ntargeted in line with the epidemiology of the epidemic.\\n \\n  574265868182919297\\n6060799684889195100\\n0 20 40 60 80 100Risk reduction for sex workersRisk reduction for MSMHarm reduction for IDUAccess to HIV testing and \\ncounsellingCondom promotionInformation, education and \\ncommunication on risk reductionPrevention of mother -to-child \\ntransmissionUniversal precautions in health \\nsettingsSafe blood\\npercentageGovernments\\nCivil Society  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\n \\n \\n2.2 Injecting drug users  \\nThere is strong evidence that IDU are particularly affected by HIV in Europe and central  Asia. It is also clear that \\nHIV transmission among IDU can be controlled if effective services are provided on  a sufficient scale to make a \\ndifference. Key measures of scale include the number of needles/ syringes distributed per IDU per year and the \\npercentage of IDU receiving opioid substitut ion therapy (OST). There is a need for all countries to aspire to the \\nhigh levels of programme coverage that have already been achieved by some.  \\nOf countries with data on HIV prevalence among IDU, almost half (46%) reported high preval ence rates of > 5% \\n(see Figure 14). These are particularly distributed in the eastern and south -western parts of the region. Just over a \\nquarter (27%) of countries reported moderate prevalence rates of 1 –5%. These included a number of countries in \\nnorthern Europe. Countries in  south -eastern and central Europe reported low (< 1%) or moderate (1 –5%) \\nprevalence among IDU.  \\nFigure  14: HIV prevalence among IDU in Europe and central  Asia  \\n \\n \\nInternationally, it is recogn ised that HIV -related services targeted towards IDU should includ e nine elements:  \\nneedle and syringe programmes; OST and other drug dependence treatment; HIV testing and counselling; ART ; \\nprevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; condom programmes for IDU and their sexual \\npartners; targeted informatio n, education and communication for IDU and their sexual partners; vaccination, \\ndiagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis; and prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.  \\nFifteen countries reported coverage of OST. Of these, almost all (87%) were EU/EFTA countries. Most of these \\n(77%) reported coverage above 30%. The three exceptions were Estonia (5%), Hungary (20%) and Lithuania \\n(15%). The two non -EU/EFTA countries reporting coverage of OST, Azerbaijan and Bosnia and Herzegovina, also \\nreported low  coverage levels. Ten countries reported the number of needles/ syringes distributed per IDU per year. \\nMost (70%) of those were EU/EFTA countries  and all of these reported coverage levels exceeding 100 \\nneedles/ syringes per IDU per year. Of the three non -EU/EFTA countries reporting figure s, Croatia reported needle \\ndistribution above this level but Azerbaijan and Bosnia and Herzegovina reported lower levels.  \\nAmong countries that reported quantitative data, almost two thirds (64%) reported rates of condom use o f 50% or \\nless among IDU. These rates of reported condom use are lower than for other key populations. For example, \\namong 21 countries with data on condom use among IDU, MSM and sex workers, the mean reported rates were \\n35% for IDU, 59% for MSM and 81% for sex workers (see Figure 15). Countries reported a wide variety of data on \\nthe injecting behaviour of IDU. The United Kingdom reported data over a nine -year period which shows a decline \\nin sharing injecting equipment in England and Wales. This is strong evi dence that effective programmes, e.g. \\nneedles/ syringe programmes, on a large scale can be effective in influencing the HIV-related risk behaviour of IDU.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  15: Comparison of rates of reported condom use among IDU, MSM and sex workers  \\n \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need for all countries of the region to scale up the provision of HIV programmes for IDU to levels \\ncurrently recommended by WHO6. In particular, this should include ensuring the  provision of sterile \\ninjecting equipment, such as needles and syringes, at a sufficient level, i.e. greater than 200 \\nneedles/ syringes per IDU per year7\\n• There is a need to improve the rate of adoption of systematic estimation of the size  of IDU populations \\nusing the methodology recommended by the EMCDDA.  . It should also include ensuring that OST  is provided to a high \\nproportion (at least 30 –40%) of opioid -using IDU.  \\n• There is a need to improve the coverage and representativeness of HIV prevalence estimation studies in the \\ncountries of the region.  \\n• Access to ART and HIV voluntary counselling and testing among IDU needs to be improved, both in community settings and attached to addiction and other health services.  \\n• There is a need for HIV prevention programmes am ong IDU to ensure adequate focus on preventing sexual \\ntransmission of HIV, including the provision of condoms and promotion of their use by IDU and their sexual partners.  \\n• There is a need to replace the current composite UNGASS indicator for measuring HIV programme coverage \\namong IDU with more relevant indicators such as the number of needles /syringes distributed per IDU; the \\nproportion of IDU receiving OST ; and the proportion of HIV -positive IDU receiving ART.  \\n \\n                                                                    \\n6 WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS .

In countries in the west \\nof the region, rates were mostly high (> 5%). In the centre and east, most countries reported moderate rates (1 –\\n5%), although both Turkey and Uzbekistan reported high prevalence rates (See Figure 16). Additional data from \\nsome countries suggests increasing HIV infection among MSM.  \\nWhile it is well known that MSM have been particularly  affected by HIV in certain countries, particularly in the west \\nof the region, there is also evidence that they are more affected than previously recogn ised in other parts of the \\nregion. In some countries, there are concerns that self -reported MSM transmission may be under -reported because \\nof social and cultural norms concerning sex between men.  \\nFigure  16: Reported HIV prevalence among MSM in Europe and central  Asia  \\n \\n \\nAlthough there are widely differing approaches to measuring coverage of HIV prevention programmes among MSM \\nin Europe and central  Asia, coverage remains low in many count ries. There is evidence from some countries (e.g. \\nAzerbaijan, Serbia, Sweden, United Kingdom and Uzbekistan) of higher coverage among older MSM, MSM in large cities, more educated MSM and men who consider themselves homosexual rather than bisexual. As a re sult, \\nparticular groups of MSM ( the young, those outside capital cities, those who are less well educated and those who \\nidentify themselves as bisexual ) are less likely to be reached by HIV programmes.  \\nThere is a considerable variation in reported rates of  HIV testing among  MSM in the region, ranging from less than \\n1% in Poland to 70% in Kyrgyzstan. Fourteen countries reported HIV testing rates of less than 30%, 15 reported rates of between 30% and 60% and four  reported  rates above 60%  (Belgium, Italy , Kyrgyzstan and the \\nNetherlands).  \\nSimilarly, there is considerable variation in reported rates of HIV -related knowledge and condom use and the \\ncomparison (see Figure  17) shows no obvious pattern.  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n19 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  17: Comparison of HIV -related knowledge and condom use among MSM  reported by selected \\ncountries in Europe and central  Asia  \\n \\nRates of unprotected anal sex remain unacceptably high among some MSM. In several countries, around one third \\nof MSM (27 –40%) reported having unprotected anal sex, particularly with casual partners. There is some evidence \\nthat unprotected anal sex is more common among particular groups of MSM, including younger men, less well educated men, men without a steady partner, men who seek partners on the internet and men who used drugs \\nbefore sex. Although there are concerns that rising rates of unprotected anal sex may be driving increased rates of \\nHIV transmission among MSM in some countries, evidence from Germany d id not indicate  declining safer sex \\npractices among MSM. Further research into these issues is currently ongoing through the European MSM Internet \\nSurvey.  \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• The need for all countries of the region to recogn ise the continued risk of HIV transmission among MSM and \\nto demonstrate the political leadership to respond appropriately, e.g. by addressing discriminatory policies \\nand legislation, and providing appropriate and accessible services. Reports of rising rates of HIV infection \\namong MSM in many countries of the region are a cause of great concern requiring urgent and determined \\naction.  \\n• There is a need to improve region -wide data collection and analysis of trends on specific risks and risk \\nperception in MSM communities through development of behavioural sur veillance programmes.  \\n• There is a need for data collection and programme responses to recogn ise that MSM are a heterogeneous \\ngroup and that some MSM are more vulnerable to HIV infection and less likely to be reached by HIV \\nprevention programmes than others.   \\n• There is a need to review the relevance of current indicators. For example, if knowledge indicators are to be \\nused, they need to be more specific for MSM. Greater clarity is needed on how to measure coverage of HIV \\nprevention programmes for MSM. Indicato rs of HIV testing and counselling may need to be tailored to \\nspecific policy environments. For example, it makes sense to enquire about testing in the last year if the aim \\nis to test each MSM once per year. A focus on measuring reported condom use is highl y appropriate given \\nconcerns that unprotected anal sex is still one of the major determinant s of HIV transmission among MSM \\nin the region. Disaggregated data about condom use with different types of partner and with regards to HIV \\nstatus may be of particul ar value.  \\n  0102030405060708090100percentageKnowledge\\nCondom use  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\n \\n \\n2.4 Sex workers  \\nAlthough sex work has been demonstrated to be a key driver of the HIV epidemic in some parts of the world, this \\ndoes not seem to be the case in Europe and central  Asia. In almost all countries of the region, HIV prevalence \\nrates among sex workers are < 5% and some countries have formally decided that sex workers are no longer a \\npriority in their national response to HIV. The fact that reported HIV prevalence among  sex workers exceeds  1% in \\n14 countries is, however, of concern  (see Figure 18).  \\nReported data also suggest that HIV prevalence is higher among specific sub -groups of sex workers, including sex \\nworkers who inject drugs, male and transgender sex workers, street sex workers and sex workers from countries with general ised H IV epidemics. For example, the Netherlands reported data showing that prevalence among sex \\nworkers who inject drugs and transgender sex workers was as high as 20% in some settings, compared with 3% or less among  female sex workers who did not inject drugs.  Israel and the United Kingdom reported data showing \\nhigher prevalence among male sex workers than among female sex workers, and Norway attributed the recent \\nincrease in prevalence to an increase of  sex workers from countries with general ised epidemics.  \\nFigure  18: Report ed HIV prevalence among sex workers in Europe and central  Asia  \\n \\nHowever, prevalence data for these specific groups of sex workers are  very limited. Likewise, there are limited data \\non prevalence among young sex workers, who are often consi dered to be more vulnerable than older sex workers. \\nOnly two countries, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, reported data disaggregated by age. Data availability was better \\nfor condom use by sex workers (65%) than for other indicators, such as pro gramme coverage (see Figure  19). \\nFigure  19: Percentage of countries reporting data on indicators relating to sex workers  \\n \\n5557375565\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70HIV prevalence HIV testingProgramme coverage KnowledgeCondom use\\npercentage  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\n \\n \\nThere is no shared understanding of how programme coverage should be measured. The UNGASS indicator is a \\ncomposite indicator that reflects very limited  services, specifically whether a sex worker knows where to go for an \\nHIV test and has been given condoms in the last 12 months. The lack of clarity over method and a perceived lack of relevance may be factors in the relatively low proportion of countries in the region reporting data on this \\nindicator. Similarly, only 55% of countries reported data on HIV -related knowledge, which again suggests that this \\nindicator is not considered to be particularly relevant or useful.   \\nHowever, based on reported data, cov erage of HIV prevention programmes  for sex workers varies considerably \\nbetween countries. The evidence presented suggests that coverage is inadequate in a number of countries, \\nincluding those where there is known to be an overlap between sex work and injec ting drug use. Less is known \\nabout coverage among specific sub- groups of sex workers that may be at higher risk of HIV infection.  \\nSimilarly, reported data on HIV -related knowledge, condom use and HIV testing suggest that there are wide \\nvariations between c ountries in the extent to which sex workers have accurate knowledge about HIV transmission \\nand prevention, use condoms consistently and have been tested for HIV. In most cases, reported data relate to \\nfemale sex workers and less is known with respect to th ese indicators for  male sex workers, transgender sex \\nworkers or other sub- groups of sex workers.  \\nThe disparity between HIV -related knowledge  and condom use (see Figure 20) suggests that knowledge may not \\nbe a particularly reliable determinant of behaviour  or that the indicator for knowledge does not measure relevant \\nknowledge. Other factors, such as a supportive legal and working environment where condom use is considered to \\nbe the norm, may also be more significant in influencing condom use. The data prov ided suggest that more \\nmarginal ised sex workers, for example street sex workers and those who also inject drugs, are less likely to use \\ncondoms consistently with clients. Further research is required to identify the factors that support or limit safe \\npractices. \\nFigure  20: Levels of HIV -related knowledge and condom use among sex workers reported by \\nselected countries in Europe and central  Asia  \\n \\nIn addition, UNGASS indicators do not address some issues that may be of particular relevance in the region, \\nincluding the diversity of the sex industry, the links between sex work and injecting drug use, the links between \\nsex work and human trafficking ( see Section  3.1), and  male and transgender sex workers.  \\n  14243663\\n483\\n355485\\n778497\\n94 9495\\n91\\n0102030405060708090100\\nRomania Lithuania Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Georgia Estonia Bulgaria ArmeniapercentageHIV-related \\nknowledge\\nCondom use  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues t hat need further action:  \\n• Although sex work per se  may not be a major driver of HIV transmission in most countries of the region, \\nthere is a need to identify and work for improved prevention with those sub- groups of sex workers who \\nmay be at elevated risk of HIV. This is likely to include sex workers who also inject drugs, male and \\ntransgender sex workers, street sex workers, young sex workers and sex workers from countries with \\ngeneral ised HIV epidemics.  \\n• There is a need for all countries to ensure high cov erage of programmes for sex workers, particularly those \\nwho are most vulnerable to HIV infection. In many countries of the region, this will include sex workers who \\ninject drugs.  \\n• There is a need for countries to review the relevance of current indicators to measure HIV -related \\nknowledge among sex workers and to identify indicators to measure programme coverage that are \\nappropriate to the regional context, including indicators that are flexible enough to take account of the \\ndiverse  nature of sex work and se x workers. It may be worth focusing efforts on those indicators which \\ncountries appear to consider most relevant, such as the rate of reported condom use.    \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n23 \\n \\n \\n \\n2.5 Migrants  \\nIssues relating to HIV and migrants are important for the countries of Europe and centr al Asia. Fifty-nine per cent  \\nof the countries responding , regarded migrants as an important sub- population in their national response to HIV  \\nand a lmost three quarters (72%) of responding EU/EFTA countries did so  (see Figure  21). \\nFigure  21: Map showing the extent to which countries identify migrants as an important sub -\\npopulation in the national response to HIV and AIDS  \\n \\n \\nAlthough the  definitions of the term ‘migrants’ vary considerably across the region, t here is strong evidence that \\nmigrants from countrie s with general ised HIV epidemics are disproportionately affected by  HIV in many EU/EFTA \\ncountries. But there is no compelling evidence that other migrant groups, independent of risk factors such as \\ninjecting drug use, are particularly affected by HIV in th e region. A number of countries, such as the Czech \\nRepublic, Estonia and the United Kingdom reported that a particular ethnic group and/or group of migrants were \\ndisproportionately affected by HIV, but this is more likely to reflect injecting drug use (see Section  2.2) than \\nethnicity or migration per se . \\nThis chapter presents the rich and varied data that countries have available relating to migrants and HIV. Much of \\nthis is qualitative in nature. Relatively few countries have robust, quantitative data avai lable, apart from figure s \\nderived from HIV and AIDS case reporting. For example, only six countries reported data on rates of HIV testing among migrants. Of these, only three (France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) reported rates of HIV \\ntesting am ong migrants from countries with general ised HIV epidemics. Eight countries reported quantitative data \\nrelated to the access of migrants to ART . Only four countries reported data on the HIV -related knowledge and \\nbehaviour of migrant populations. However , none of these corresponded fully to the standard indicators used by \\nUNAIDS for UNGASS reporting related to other key populations.  \\nSeveral countries reported barriers and obstacles to  delivering HIV -related services to migrants.  The most \\ncommonly  reported o bstacles included la nguage barriers (16 countries), cultural differences (10), issues relating to \\nfear, stigma and discrimination (6), rel igious differences (4) and lack of services in the locations where migrants \\nlived (3).  \\nCountries reported particular challenges in providing services to undocumented migrants. For example, some \\ncountries provide health services through insurance schemes. By definition, undocumented migrants do not usually \\nbelong to such schemes. In other countries, undocumented migrants are afraid of using health services for fear of \\nbeing detected and removed from the country.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn general, most countries report that their laws and policies are based on the principle of providing services \\nequitably to all in need of them. However, some cou ntries reported having restrictions on entry and residence for \\npeople living with HIV . In other countries, some categories of migrants may not benefit from the social security \\nsystem in place in the country. Some ethnic minorities in some countries may lac k access to health insurance cover \\nbecause they do not have a permanent address.  \\nAlthough a few countries, for example, Italy and Portugal, make a clear commitment to provide ART to \\nundocumented migrants who need it, most countries do not do this. In some  countries, the extent to which a \\nperson is eligible for services is explicitly linked to their immigration status.  \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• Although it is entirely appropriate for countries to defi ne migrants in a way that is appropriate to their \\ncontext, there is a need for selected standard definitions of categories of migrants in relation to HIV in \\nEurope. There is a strong argument for one of these categories to be someone born in a country with  a \\ngeneral ised HIV epidemic.  \\n• There is a need for EU/EFTA countries to develop and expand programmes for migrants from countries with \\ngeneral ised HIV epidemics. There is also a need to develop ways of monitoring whether these programmes \\nare being delivered on a sufficient scale.  \\n• There is a need to ensure that programmes focused on other key populations, for example, sex workers, \\nMSM and IDU, provide equitable access to services, including to those born in other countries or having a particular nationality or  ethnicity, regardless of legal status. In some contexts, ensuring equitable access \\nmay require additional resources for specific services targeting migrants  within these key populations.  \\n• There is a need to develop a standard set of HIV indicators for inc lusion in a regional European monitoring \\nand evaluation system.    \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n25 \\n \\n \\n \\n2.6 Prisoners  \\nPrisons are an important environment for the response to HIV in the countries of Europe and central  Asia. Injecting \\ndrug users are particularly at risk of HIV infection and frequently spend time in the prison system. Within the \\nprison system, there are risks of HIV transmission through sharing contaminated injecting equipment and \\nunprotected sex.  Just under half (47%) of all reporting countries provided quantitative data for HIV  prevalence \\namong prisoners. Reported HIV prevalence varied from 0% (Czech Republic and Croatia) to 14.5% (Ukraine).  \\nAlthough the vast majority of prisoners in countries of the region are male, some countries have collected and \\nprovided disaggregated data for HIV prevalence by sex. In some countries, such as Kyrgyzstan and the United \\nKingdom, HIV prevalence among women prisoners was higher than among men.  Rates of HIV prevalence among \\nprisoners are high, particularly when disaggregated to show rates for tho se who inject drugs and those who do not, \\ne.g. in Kazakhstan.  \\nAlmost all (92%) responding countries provided some information about the HIV policy environment in prisons in \\ntheir country. Of these:  \\n• almost all (84%) reported that their country’s multi -sectoral strategy/action framework addressed prisons; \\nand \\n• almost three quarters (73%) reported that they have a strategy/action framework for addressing HIV and \\nAIDS issues among its national uniformed services, including prison staff . \\nIn addition, most countri es reported having  a policy and/or strategy to promote information, education and \\ncommunication and other preventive health interventions for prisoners. Figure 22 shows the percentage of country \\nstrategies/policies with particular elements.  \\nFigure  22: Per centage of countries with a policy and/or strategy to promote information, education \\nand communication and other preventive health interventions for prisoners that includes particular \\nelements  \\n \\nAll policies and strategies are reported to include targeted information on risk reduction and HIV education. Almost \\nall (90%) include HIV testing and counselling. More than three quarters include condom promotion (79%) and \\nreproductive health, including sexually transmitted infection ( STI) prevention and treatment (77%). Two thirds \\n(67%) refer to stigma and discrimination reduction. Worryingly, o nly just over one third (36%) report drug \\nsubstitution therapy and less than one fifth (18%) report needle and syringe exchange.  \\nLess than half (44%) of countries providing information on this issue indicated that their country has non-\\ndiscrimination laws or regulations that specify protection for prisoners, and 40% report that the country has laws, \\nregulations or policies that present obstacles to effective HIV prevention, t reatment, care and support for prisoners. \\nFor example, of the 40 countries providing information on whether or not they conduct mandatory HIV testing in \\nprisons, 34 said they did not and six confirmed that mandatory testing in prisons was part of their nat ional policies .  \\nIt is critical that equivalent HIV services are provided for IDU in prisons as in the community. International \\nagencies have proposed that these services should, as a minimum, include nine elements ( see Section  2.2). \\nHowever, it is clear t hat some of these services are more available in prisons than others. For example, all \\ncountries report providing targeted HIV information to prisons, yet far fewer provide key services, such as drug \\nsubstitution therapy and needle/ syringe programmes (see Figure 23).  100677990773618\\n0 20 40 60 80 100Targeted informationStigma and discrimination Condom promotionHIV testing and counsellingReproductive health and \\nSTIsDrug substitution therapyNeedle and syringe \\nexchange\\npercentage  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  23: Maps showing the extent to which opioid substitution therapy and needle /syringe \\nprogrammes are reported to be available in prisons in Europe and central  Asia  \\nOpioid substitution therapy  \\n \\n \\nNeedle/syringe programmes  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\n \\n \\nEU/EFTA countr ies are clearly taking the lead in providing OST in prisons. Almost three quarters (71%) of EU/EFTA \\ncountries report providing OST in at least some of their prisons. But only just over a quarter (29%) of non -\\nEU/EFTA countries do so . The picture is less cle ar for needle/ syringe programmes. Only nine countries reported \\nthat needle and syringe programmes are available in any of their prisons. Only three countries reported providing \\nsuch programmes in all or most of their prisons (Kyrgyzstan, Luxembourg and Spa in). Forty countries provided \\ninformation on whether or not they conduct mandatory testing in prisons. Most do not but it is of concern that six \\ndo report carrying out such testing.  \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further  action:  \\n• There is a need for essential HIV prevention programmes to be as available in prisons as they are in \\ncommunity settings. In particular, this should include harm reduction services for IDU, such as OST  and \\nprovision of sterile injecting equipment and condoms.  \\n• There is also a need to ensure equivalence in access to HIV treatment and care services in prison and \\ncommunity settings, including access to TB diagnosis and treatment.   \\n• There is an opportunity for countries not currently providing drug subst itution therapy in their prisons to \\nemulate EU/EFTA countries that do provide this service.  \\n• There is an opportunity for countries not currently providing sterile injecting equipment to IDU in their \\nprisons to emulate the few countries that are demonstratin g leadership in this area.  \\n• There is a need for all countries in Europe and central  Asia to recogn ise that mandatory HIV tes ting in \\nprison settings violates  the widely accepted principle of self -determination in the area of health, and cannot \\nbe justified f rom a public health perspective.  Routine offering of HIV  testing in prison settings with \\nappropriate provision of test information may provide better acceptance and result in attachment to the \\nhealth system.  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n28 \\n \\n \\n \\n2.7 Promotion of sexual health among young peo ple \\nGlobally, 40% of new HIV infections occur in the 15 –24 year age group. Consequently, young people are often \\ndescribed as a high risk or vulnerable population. However, i n Europe and central  Asia, the extent to which young \\npeople should be considered a ‘risk group’ that is more vulnerable to HIV is an issue about which there are widely \\ndiffering views.  \\nThere is consensus that young people should be taught about HIV as part of a programme of sexual and \\nreproductive health education in schools. Almost all  countries (84%) have a policy or strategy to promote HIV -\\nrelated reproductive and sexual health education for young people. However, although more than three quarters (76%) of countries include HIV education in the secondary school curriculum, fewer count ries report that HIV \\neducation is included in the teacher training curriculum (55%) or that HIV education is included in the primary school curriculum (43%) (see Figure 24). \\nFigure  24: Percentage of countries reporting that HIV education is part of the pri mary school, \\nsecondary school and teacher training curricula  \\n \\nHowever, not all young people are equally at risk of HIV infection. There is a need for better data on, and more tailored programmes for, sub -groups of young people who may be at elevated HIV r isk, such as young people who \\ninject drugs or engage in sex work, young people in prisons and young men who have sex with men.  \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need to recogn ise that young peopl e are not a homogeneous group in terms of HIV risk in the \\nregion. More data is needed on the heterogeneity of this risk. Service provision needs to be focused on \\nthose young people particularly at risk of HIV infection, such as young IDU, young sexual part ners of IDU, \\nyoung sex workers, young MSM, young migrants fr om high prevalence regions and young people in \\ncorrectional and prison settings.  \\n• There is a need for countries of Europe and central  Asia to provide high quality sexual and reproductive \\nhealth edu cation, with integrated HIV/STI risk information, to their young people. Overall, there is a need \\nfor this to be provided in more countries’ schools and for this to be included in curricula used to train teachers.  4376\\n55\\n0102030405060708090100\\nPrimary school \\ncurriculumSecondary school \\ncurriculumTeacher training \\ncurriculumpercentage  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n \\n \\n \\n3 LIVING WITH HIV  \\n3.1 Treatment and c are \\nThere have been significant increases in the numbers of PLHIV receiving ART in countries of Europe and central  \\nAsia since 2004 (see Figure  25). Some countries, where numbers on treatment were low, such as Estonia, Russia \\nand Ukraine, have made good progress although they were starting from a very low level and there are still \\nconcerns that not all those who need treatment receive it promptly.  \\nFigure  25: Trend data for ART in s elected countries of Europe and central  Asia  \\n \\n \\n \\nThe main issue regarding prompt  delivery of treatment to those who need it is not related to providing treatment \\nto those who are known to need it. Most countries in Europe and central  Asia report high levels of ART coverage \\nfor those known to be HIV positive. Rather the issue is the ex tent to which PLHIV in the region who need \\ntreatment are unaware of their HIV status,  i.e. they have not been diagnosed.

Most countries follow the same strategy of offering HIV testing to all \\npregnant women and then offering a range of services for  women who test positive and their infants. Less than \\nhalf (45%) of reporting countries provided information on either the number of infants infected with HIV as a \\nresult of mother -to-child transmissio n or the rate of mother -to-child transmission. Some countries, such as Estonia, \\nthe Netherlands, Poland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, presented evidence that the rate of infection through \\nthis route has declined. In Poland, this decline was from 23% in 1989 to < 1% and in Ukraine from 27.8% in 2001 \\nto 7.1% in 2006. Other countries commented that remaining infections through mother -to-child transmission \\nlargely occur among particular sub -populations such as migrants and IDU. Although the numbers of infect ions \\noccurring through this route are very low, the fact that some countries still experience easily  preventable mother -\\nto-child transmission must be consider ed unacceptable and a failure of the healthcare systems.  \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the fo llowing issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need for countries of Europe and central  Asia to focus on addressing the critical issue of late \\ndiagnosis of HIV infection as this is resulting in delays in starting ART for a significant number of PLHIV . \\nThis could include rigorously  tracking the proportion of PLHIV with late diagnosis, i.e. a CD4 count < 350 at \\nthe time of diagnosis and introducing measures aimed at reduc ing the proportion of PLHIV who receive a  \\nlate HIV diagnosis.  \\n• There is a need for c ountries of Europe and central  Asia to address the obstacles faced by some populations \\nin accessing ART. These include, in particular, IDU, prisoners and migrants.   \\n• Although data on the issue are  not completely clear, the fact that some countries still experience easily  \\npreventable mother -to-child transmission, albeit limited, cannot be considered acceptable in the region. \\nThere is a need for some countries to review their procedures and practices to identify specific client -\\noriented solutions to ensure prevention of such cases in the near future.    \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n33 \\n \\n \\n \\n3.2 Stigma and discrimination  \\nOnly just over a third (39%) of countries were able to provide quantitative or qualitative data about attitudes \\ntowards people living with HIV. Although the picture is mixed, it appea rs that there are high rates of discriminatory \\nattitudes/low rates of accepting attitudes in some countries and low rates of discriminatory attitudes/high rates of \\naccepting attitudes in others. Nevertheless, there are a significant number of people in all  countries who support \\nhighly discriminatory measures towards PLHIV.    \\nOverall, people appear more likely to express accepting attitudes towards PLHIV within their immediate circle of \\nfamily and friends, rather than PLHIV encountered in workplaces or schoo ls. Broadly speaking, it appears that \\nmore accepting attitudes are held by younger people, women, more educated people and those living in urban \\nareas. There is some evidence to suggest that stigma and discrimination are  associated with negative views abou t \\nparticular population groups such as IDU, MSM, sex workers and migrants rather than only about PLHIV per se .  \\nIn general, countries report that appropriate policies are in place to address HIV -related stigma and discrimination. \\nHowever, it is less clear how well these are implemented. For example, almost all countries (84%) report that \\nstigma and discrimination are addressed in national HIV strategies but this is not consistently reflected in policies \\nand programmes (see Figure  30). Less than half of countries (43%) have a policy prohibiting screening for general \\nemployment purposes and only just over just over half (55%) have programmes in place to reduce HIV -related \\nstigma and discrimination.  \\nFigure  30: Percentage of countries reporting that stigma and discrimination are  addressed in \\nstrategy, policy and programmes  \\n \\nThe same pattern is seen with non -discrimination laws and regulations. Around half of the countries report general \\nnon-discrimination laws that guarantee the rights of all cit izens or non- discrimination laws or regulations that \\nspecify protections for most -at-risk or other vulnerable sub- populations. MSM, prisoners and migrants are more \\nlikely to be covered by non -discrimination laws or regulations than IDU or sex workers (see Figure 31). Overall, \\ncivil society respondents are less likely to consider that these laws and regulations exist than government \\nrespondents.  Fewer countries report mechanisms to ensure laws are implemented or to address cases of \\ndiscrimination or human rights violations . And while more than half of countries report non -discrimination laws and \\nregulations that specify protection for PLHIV, again this is only backed up by mechanisms to address cases of \\ndiscrimination experienced by PLHIV in a third of countries. These findings highlight a gap between the protection \\nof human rights on paper and actual practice.  \\n  84\\n4355\\n0102030405060708090\\nStigma and discrimination addressed \\nin national strategy or action planPolicy prohibiting screening for \\ngeneral employment purposesProgrammes to reduce stigma and \\ndiscriminationpercentage  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n34 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure  31: Percentage of government and civil society respondents reporting the existence of non -\\ndiscrimination laws and regulations covering specific populations \\n \\nIn conclusion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need for countries to continue and expand efforts to address HIV -related stigma and \\ndiscrimination. In particular, there is a need to ensure that mechanisms exi st to address stigma and \\ndiscrimination when they occur, and that these mechanisms are well  used.  \\n• It is useful for countries to track the existence of both accepting and discriminatory attitudes among the \\npopulation through periodic surveys. However, it is essential that the questions used are relevant to the \\ncountries of the region. It would also be useful if questions were extended to include stigma and \\ndiscrimination experienced by marginal ised populations who are also particularly affected by HIV, in \\naddition to stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV.  \\n• The European  Commission could consider charging the European Union Agency for Fundamental Right s to \\nconduct thorough research and analysis on the issue of HIV -related discrimination in Europe.  2228555254\\n3844717588\\n0102030405060708090100\\nSex workers IDU MSM Prisoners MigrantspercentageCivil society\\nGovernment  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n35 \\n \\n \\n \\n4 MO NITORING AND EVALUATION  \\n4.1 Political leadership : monitoring and evaluation  \\nAlmost all countries of Europe and central  Asia report having structures and systems in place for monitoring their \\nnational responses to HIV. For example, 85% of countries report t hat they have or are developing a national \\nmonitoring and evaluation  plan. However, some elements of these plans are better developed than others. For \\nexample, while almost all countries have systems for HIV and behavioural surveillance,  far fewer have a s trategy \\nfor assessing the quality and accuracy of data or a budget for the M&E plan (see Figure 32). \\nFigure  32: Percentage of responses from all countries and EU/EFTA countries on whether the \\nHIV/AIDS M&E plan includes specific elements  \\n \\nThere are concer ns that the requirements of a national M&E system, as defined by international agencies and \\nencapsulated in the third of the ‘Three Ones’ principles9\\nCollecting data on the epidemic and the response in a country is not the main problem. A rich plethora of data are \\navailable in the countri es of Europe and central  Asia. The main problem is that that information is not used \\nconsistently to guide national responses to HIV. For example, many countries have strong evidence that HIV \\ntransmission is concentrated among particular sub- populations, such as IDU and MSM. Despite this, some countries \\nhave been reluctant to focus the national HIV response on evidence -based programmes for these populations. In \\nsome cases this is due to negative political and public opinion towards these populations and pro grammes. However, \\nit is essential that national HIV responses focus on sub -populations that are particularly affected by HIV in order to \\nprevent further transmission and to provide appropriate treatment, care and support for those living with HIV.  , may be too rigid and prescriptive for countries in Europe \\nand central  Asia. For example, it is unclear ho w relevant the third ‘One’ (one agreed country -level M&E system) is \\nfor countries with highly  decentral ised federal structures. While data are  needed to understand the HIV epidemic \\nand ensure that the response is appropriate for the particular drivers of t he national epidemic, countries are able to \\nensure such data is collected using a variety of systems and structures.  \\nIn concl usion, ECDC has identified the following issues that need further action:  \\n• There is a need to ensure that monitoring and evaluation data is analys ed and used to ensure that national \\nresponses to HIV are appropriate to the nature of the HIV epidemic in any particular countr y. \\n• Countries need to ensure that they have appropriate systems and adequate human and financial resources \\nto monitor and evaluate the national HIV response. However, M&E needs to be country -driven and the \\nsystems used for these activities m ay vary according to the country context.  \\n• There is a need to review and revise the questions used to assess the adequacy of monitoring and \\nevaluation of HIV responses. This may involve a shift away from a normative focus on the t hird ‘One’, one \\nagreed  country -level mon itoring and evaluation system, to an approach that focuses more on whether \\ncountries have the information they need about their epidemic and their response, and how that information is used.  \\n \\n                                                                    \\n9 UNAIDS. “ Three Ones” key principles.

Following that, UNAIDS introduced a system of ‘UNGASS reporting’ focused on the   implementation \\nof the Declaration of Commitment based on progress reported by UN member states, against a number of agreed \\nindicators. Reporting takes place every two years. To date, there have been four rounds of UNGASS reporting –  in \\n2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010.  \\nAccording to UNAIDS, the rate of reporting on UNG ASS by countries in Europe and central  Asia to 2008 had been \\nlower than in other regions. Within the region, the rate of reporting had been higher in e astern Europe and c entral \\nAsia than in w estern Europe (see Figure  33). \\nFigure  33: UNGASS reporting rates , by region, 2004 –08  \\n \\nSource: UNAIDS presentation to advisory group  \\nThis relatively  low rate of reporting to date, particularly among EU/EFTA countries, reflects a number of concerns \\nabout the UNGASS process. First ly, the overall process of UNGASS reporti ng is seen as donor -driven, which makes \\nit appear more relevant to developing countries than to developed ones. Secondly , some of the topic areas  covered \\nby UNGASS indicators , e.g. orphans and vulnerable children, are seen as more relevant to the general ised \\nepidemics in eastern and southern Africa than the concentrated epidemics of Europe and central  Asia. Third ly, \\nsome populations of particular interest to the region, e.g. migrants (see Section  2.5) and prisoners (see Section  2.6) \\nare currently largely o verlooked by UNGASS reporting. Finally, a number of specific UNGASS indicators are not \\nseen to be relevant in the region because the thematic area is monitored in a different way or because the \\nmonitoring is not considered essential or cost -effective for th e specific country context.  \\nIf developed countries are going to report on UNGASS, there is a need to make a stronger case for the benefits of improved international and regional reporting. Tangible benefits such as shared learning, inter -country \\nbenchmark ing and regional analysis of issues that affect multiple countries are much more compelling reasons to \\nreport than the argument that countries are obliged to report as signatories to the UNGASS Declaration.  \\nIn addition, the benefits need to be proportiona l to the reporting burden on countries. This burden could be \\nsignificantly reduced if countries were asked to report data in a more regular and coordinated manner. A good \\nexample of this would be the introduction of a single reporting framework and schedul e for reporting on the \\nUNGASS Declaration , the Dublin Declaration and the WHO/UNICEF/UNAIDS annual global report on the scale -up of \\npriority health sector interventions for HIV prevention, treatment, care and support.  \\nThis current process of reporting on progress towards  implementing the Dublin Declaration has shown that if these \\nconcerns are addressed and countries are approached through a trusted regional body, such as ECDC, high \\nresponse rates can be achieved (see Figure 34). Overall response rates were higher (89%) for the Dublin 0102030405060708090100percentage\\n(total number of UN member states in the region)2004 (102/189) 2006 (122/191) 2008 (147/192)Year of reporting (UN member states reporting/total number of UN member states)  \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n37 \\n \\n \\n \\nDeclaration process than for UNGASS 2008 (72%).

There are a number of \\ncompelling reasons to make this shift:  \\n− Harmon ised indicators that are more epidemic - and region -specific. Harmon ising indicators should \\nalso mean there are fewer of them  which would reduce the reporting burden for countries.  \\n− The ability to identify and provide countries with clearly  defined benefits of reporting, e.g. shared  \\nlearning, inter -country benchmarking and regional analysis of issues that affect multiple countries.  \\n− The a bility of international bodies such as ECDC and WHO Regional Office  for Europe to provide \\nenhanced support for the reporting process.  \\n− Higher response rates from countries  in the region . \\n• There is an urgent need to combine the multiple reporting mechanisms currently being used by international organ isation s, including UNGASS, into one exercise. The various international stakeholders \\ncould then extract th e data from the consolidated process to use in their different reports. Conducting a \\nsingle exercise would make it a more routine activity for countries, which is likely to make it easier to manage internally and easier to support externally, e.g. through ECDC. Clarity is needed on what data need \\nto be reported and how often.  6583\\n7294\\n8389\\n0102030405060708090100\\nEU/EFTA Non EU/EFTA OverallpercentageUNGASS\\nDublin Declaration  \\n \\n \\n \\nImplementing the Dublin Declaration: 2010 Progress Report  SPECIAL  REPORT  \\n \\n \\n \\n38 \\n \\n \\n \\n5 Conclusions  \\nSpecific conclusions for each thematic area have been included at the end of each section . This chapter focuses on \\nthe main overall conclusions emerging from the review , particularly those that cut across a number of thematic areas.  \\n1 There is evidence of strong political commitment  (Section  1.1) for the response to HIV in European  and \\ncentral  Asian countries . However, this commitment is not seen uniformly across all count ries and is not well  \\nreflected by international indicators of political commitment that focus on the existence of a national HIV \\nstrategic framework and a multi -sectoral, national AIDS coordinating body. Rather, it is seen in those \\ncountries that have demo nstrated the political leadership needed to address HIV effectively among those \\npopulations most  affected by the epidemic. For example, this includes:  \\n− focusing HIV prevention spending on those populations most  affected by HIV (see Section  1.3); \\n− ensuring that effective programmes, such as harm reduction services for IDU (see Section  2.2), are \\nprovided on a sufficient scale ;  \\n− ensuring a supportive legal and policy environment for work among key populations like MSM (see \\nSection  2.3); and \\n− ensuring that essenti al HIV prevention services are available, including  in prison settings ( see Section  \\n2.6). \\n2 The role of civil society  (Section  1.2) in responses to HIV is recogn ised across countries of Europe and \\ncentral  Asia. Civil society organ isation s are involved in str ategic planning processes in many countries of the \\nregion, and civil society considers that the environment in which they operate improved between 2005 and \\n2007. However, civil society organ isation s still face considerable challenges in ensuring sustainabl e funding \\nfor their activities. In addition, although reviews like this often consider the views of civil society organ isation s on the support provided to them by government, there appears to have been less focus on \\ncritical review of the activities of civ il society organ isation s by government and other stakeholders.  \\n3 Since 2004, the countries of Europe have provided considerable financial support ( Section  1.3) for the \\nglobal response to HIV. This is seen in bilateral funding to national HIV responses and in  support of key \\ninternational institutions, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and UNAIDS. However, this \\nfunding support needs to be sustained and there is a need for all countries to show the same level of \\ncommitment to this as has, to date, been shown by a rather small number of EU and EFTA countries.  \\n4 There is evidence that many countries in Europe and central  Asia have appropriately focused their HIV \\nresponses on key populations  affected by the epidemic. However, this focus is not seen  clearly in all \\ncountries. Injecting drug users ( Section  2.2) remain vulnerable to HIV infection across the region. There is \\nevidence of rising rates of HIV infection among MSM ( Section  2.3) in many countries, not only in the \\nwestern part of the region. An y focus on key populations needs to acknowledge that there are overlapping \\nvulnerabilities, e.g. for IDU in prisons and for migrant sex workers. There are also subsets of key populations who may be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection and are less like ly to access HIV services. \\nExamples include bisexual men and young IDU.  \\n5 Migrants from countries with generalised HIV epidemics  (Section  2.5) have been identified as a key \\npopulation affected by HIV in EU/EFTA countries. This group is not well  recogn ised in international HIV \\nmonitoring and reporting systems. There is an opportunity for countries of the region and regional institutions to provide leadership in monitoring responses for this population. One particular area of concern is ensuring that migrants, including those who are undocumented, gain access to ART  promptly when they \\nneed it.  \\n6 Prisoners  (Section  2.6) have been identified as another key population affected by HIV in countries of \\nEurope and central  Asia. Again, this group is not well  recogn ised in  international HIV monitoring and \\nreporting systems. There is a need for essential prevention services, particularly for IDU, to be as available in prison settings as in community settings. EU/EFTA countries have provided leadership on this for OST  but \\nprogress in providing sterile injecting equipment in prisons has, to date, been limited to very few countries.  \\n7 Since 2004, there has been an increase in the number of PLHIV receiving ART  (Section  3.1) in some \\ncountries of the region. However, these increases took place from a very low base in those countries. Obstacles to treatment still exist for key populations in many countries of the region, particularly for IDU, \\nmigrants and prisoners.  \\n8 There is also evidence from many countries of the region that rates o f late diagnosis of HIV infection  \\nremain unacceptably high with many PLHIV presenting with CD4 counts <\\n 350 cells/mm3 at the time of \\ndiagnosis. This is a significant issue because these people are starting treatment later than medically  \\nadvised. Evidence shows that late diagnosis leading to later introduction of treatment results in higher rates \\nof AIDS -related illness and death.    \\n \\n \\n \\nSPECIAL  REPORT  Implementing the Dublin Declaration : 2010 Progress Report  \\n \\n \\n \\n39 \\n \\n \\n \\n9 This review demonstrates that countries of Europe and central  Asia have large quantities of data \\navailable  concerning their respo nses to HIV. Analys es of these data provide a rich picture of the nature \\nand diversity of responses to HIV in the region. However, the degree to which this is used to focus national \\nresponses on populations most  affected by HIV varies markedly across Europ e and central  Asia. \\n10 The value of international reporting on HIV responses is recogn ised in the countries of Europe and \\ncentral  Asia. This review shows that high response rates are possible when countries are approached with \\nrelevant indicators by a trusted regional organ isation  and in a way that takes account of previously  \\nsubmitted data. Lessons can be learned for UNGASS reporting and other international reporting processes. \\nIt should be possible to introduce a single data collection process which could sa tisfy all current \\ninternational reporting requirements, e.g. monitoring the UNGASS and Dublin Declarations and monitoring \\nthe progress towards achieving universal access in the health sector. There are strong aspirations from \\ncountries that the reporting burden must be reduced by streamlining the current multiple processes into \\none. \\n  '"
