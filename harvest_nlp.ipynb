hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   1 executive summary   background   this literature review of the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening was conducted as part of a  project evaluat ing the effectiveness of antenatal screening (ans) for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella  susceptibility in eu/eea member states. the purpose of this review was to provide evidence for guidance to  strengthen antenatal screening programmes in europe.   methods   the effectiveness of antenatal screening was defined as those factors that influenc e the population completeness  with regard to the detection of infections during pregnancy  and factors that could potentially lead to mother -to- child transmission (mtct ). in the case of rubella, this refers to the identification of susceptible mothers.   the cost -effectiveness of ans was not defined because  defining the cost-effectiveness of a preventive intervention  is in many ways a  value judgement, as the acceptable cos t per prevented outcome/gained life year (adjusted or  unadjusted) depend s on a comparative valuation of different diseases and the economic situation of the country  funding the intervention .   the research question was formulated to include  the following  elements (based on a pico (t) elements) :   \\uf0b7 p (population) : pregnant women and their unborn children   \\uf0b7 i (intervention) : national programmes  for universal screening   \\uf0b7 c (comparator) : no screening or screening for high risk groups only   \\uf0b7 o (outcome) : avoided infecti ons in children and cost per infection avoided   \\uf0b7 t (time factor ): from maternal screening to confirmation of the child’s infection status.   database  searches were performed between 13 october 2011 and 12 march 2014 and covered all eu/eea  countries, the usa, canada, australia and new zealand ; search languages were  english, danish, finnish, german,  norwegian and swedish.   the literature was screened by two independent researchers ; studies were selected based on the agreed inclusion  criteria. the study quality wa s assessed in accordance with  the criteria described by guyatt et al. [1]  (effectiveness ) and by drummond et al. [2] (economic evaluations ).   results   this literature r eview on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella  susceptibility retrieved nine studies on cost -effectiveness and 37 studies on effectiveness that were included in the  analysis.   the effectiveness of antenatal screening depends on the coverage of the screening program me, the quality of  testing, and the effectiveness of treatment. the ability to reach all pregnant women, the sensitivity of the  screening test (i.e. the capacity to identify all infected women ), and the preventive  treatment received by all  infected pregnant women were factors to ensure optimal effectiveness.   the following n ational antenatal screening programmes were considered cost -effective in comparison with no  screening or screening only targeted risk groups: syphilis in norway and the united kingdom; hiv in the  netherlands, australia and new zealand; hepatitis b in the united kingdom and belgium ; rubella susceptibility in  the netherlands, especially if targeted at non -vaccinated pregnant women.   this review also showed that only a small number of cost-effectiveness studies has been conducted in europe.   conclusions   for hiv, hepatitis b and syphilis, most studies suggest that comprehensive, population -based antenatal screening is  cost effective in al l assessed  settings.   the e ffectiveness of antenatal screening programmes  has not been widely studied in europe. the available  literature mainly provide s authors ’ opinions regarding factors that influenc e effectiveness ; there are no  comparative  studies on effectiveness . implementing antenatal screening programmes was found to be cost -effective in several  countries.      effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   technical report   2 1 background   in 2011, ecdc initiated a project to evaluate the effectiveness of antenatal screening programmes for hiv,  hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility in the eu/eea.   the project included: 1) a survey of the eu/eea member states to obtain information on the current practice s of  antenatal screening for infectious diseases in order to describe country -specific approaches and iden tify areas in  need for improvement and models of good practice [3]; 2) a literature review of the published literature on  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening.   the aim of the systematic literature reviews was to collect published ev idence on the effectiveness and cost - effectiveness of antenatal screening practices for the prevention of mother -to-child transmission (mtct) of hiv,  hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella in the eu/eea countries in order to inform ecdc guidance on antenatal sc reening  in the eu/eea.   2 review methods   2.1 search strategy   information specialists conducted a systematic literature search on the cost -effectiveness and effectiveness of  screening programmes for the target ed infections during pregnancy (appendi ces 1 and 2). the search strategies  were developed by experienced information specialists in collaboration with content experts on the basis of the  research question (pico : population, intervention, comparison and outcome/s ) to retrieve relevant studies.  a combina tion of medical headings and keywords was used to search title s and abstract s. the results were  combined to exclude duplicates. all reviews were developed by senior information specialists  and content experts.   2.1.1 cost -effectiveness   research question: a re national programmes  for universal antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and  rubella susceptibility cost -effective?   the following pico (t) elements were identified  for a cost -effectiveness review :  \\uf0b7 p (population): pregnant women and their unborn children   \\uf0b7 i (intervention): national universal screening  programmes  for all pregnant women for syphilis, hiv, hepatitis  b and rubella susceptibility; therapeutic intervention for those with positive test results (rubella  susceptibility, vaccination to prevent mtct in future pregnancies)   \\uf0b7 c (comparator, reference intervention): no screening or screening for high -risk groups only   \\uf0b7 o (outcome): avoided infections in children and cost per infection avoided   \\uf0b7 t (time factor ): from maternal screening sample to co nfirmation of the child\\'s infection status.   after a discussion with experts, it was decided that life years gained (lyg), life years saved (lys), and incremental  cost-effectiveness ratios (icer) were also outcomes of interest. as outcome terms were not  used in the searches,  this addition s would not have had any effect on the search.   the references of all included articles were checked for relevant new articles (ancestry search). in october 2011,  a comprehensive search on the economic evaluation of screening programmes  for syphilis, hiv, and hepatitis b was  carried out in the following databases , starting with the publication year 1990 : ovid medline, ovid medline   daily update, ovid medline in -proces s & other non -indexed citations, nlm pubmed (epubs ahead of print), the  centre for reviews and dissemination, the cochrane database of systematic reviews, and the cochrane central  register of controlled trials.   information concerning cost -effectiveness wa s derived from a systematic literature review on economic evaluations  of antenatal screening for syphilis, hiv, and hepatitis b commissioned by  the finnish institute for health and  welfare [4] in october 2011 (updated in october 2012) . a review of economic  evaluations of rubella susceptibility  screening was carried out using a similar strategy  in october 2012 . both searches were updated in january 2014.  the search strategies and results are presented in appendix 1. grey literature from was not included.   2.1.2 effectiveness   research question: are national programmes  for universal antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and  rubella susceptibility effective , and what are the factors influencing effectiveness?   the search strategy was based on a  cost-effectiveness  search , but the term ‘ cost’ or its synonyms were not used  as search term s. the time period searched ranged from 2000 to the present ; the selected databases were the  technical report  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility     3 same as for the cost -effectiveness search  described above . the hiv search was limited to eu/eea countries, the   usa, canada, australia, and new zealand. a second search on ans effectiveness was conducted on march 2014 in  ovid medline to ensure that no important studies were missed (the previous search was limited  to publications  reporting  on the cost of screening programmes ). the search strategies and results are presented in appendix 2.  grey literature was not included.   the literature review on cost -effectiveness was based was on the following pico (t) elements:    \\uf0b7 p (population): pregnant women and their unborn children;   \\uf0b7 i (intervention): national universal screening  programmes  for all pregnant women for syphilis, hiv,  hepatitis  b and for rubella susceptibility; therapeutic intervention for those with positive test results (rubella  susceptibility, vaccination to prevent mtct in future pregnancies)   \\uf0b7 c (comparison): no screening or screening for high risk groups only   \\uf0b7 o (outcome): avoided infections in children   2.2 study selection criteria and procedure   the searches we re targeted to cost -effectiveness and  effectiveness  of screening , with the aim of finding relevant  evaluations of antenatal screening program mes. articles describing solely sensitivity and specificity of different  tests used for screening were not included  because these usually do not provide enough information about test  performance in real -world settings. we used data from high -quality screening program evaluations, as assessed  using the criteria by drummond et al. [2] for cost -effectiveness studies and b y guyatt et al. [1] for effectiveness  studies.    the exclusion criteria for the cost -effectiveness search were:   \\uf0b7 no cost  information   \\uf0b7 incorrect infection   \\uf0b7 no intervention (e.g. prevalence study)   \\uf0b7 intervention not in line with current practice   \\uf0b7 description or comparison of laboratory methods or diagnostics only   \\uf0b7 language not english, danish, finnish, german, norwegian or swedish   other reasons for exclusion  were: wrong study design, health service utilisation, treatment, ethical or legal issues,  socio-demographic  issues, attitudes, prognosis, and education .  the exclusion criteria for the effectiveness search were:   \\uf0b7 publication type without original data (editorial, letter , etc.)  \\uf0b7 country not eu, usa, canada, australia or new zealand   \\uf0b7 not national data (regional, only one city , etc.)  \\uf0b7 population not pregnant women   \\uf0b7 no intervention (e.g. prevalence study)   \\uf0b7 intervention not in line with current practice   \\uf0b7 description or comparison of laboratory methods or diagnostics only   \\uf0b7 language not english, danish, finnish, german, norwegian or swedish   \\uf0b7 other (e.g. treatment, case description)   2.2.1 cost -effectiveness   two researchers independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles and selected potentially  relevant articles based on  agreed exclusion criteria.  differing choices were discussed and doubtful cases were  included.   in the second round, the same researchers evaluated the full-text versions of potentially relevant publications using  more detailed inclusion criteria. the given c osts had to include scre ening costs as well as counselling and  treatment  costs; in addition, the articles had to mention the infections in children . disease -specific selection criteria  were clarified in discussion with infection experts: for syphilis, testing and treatment should  be completed in early  pregnancy, and in the case of hiv, highly active antiretroviral therapy should be initiated no later than at 28 weeks  of gestation. the final selection of included publications was made by consensus. in order to find more cost – benefi t analyses, the r eference s/bibliographies  of all selected articles were search ed for material s published before  the search  date.  two researchers independently assessed s tudy quality with the drummond checklist (economic evaluation ) [2];  disagreements were resolved by a third researcher .   effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   technical report   4 2.2.2 effectiveness   the evaluation procedure for publications  on effectiveness was identical to the one on publications on  cost- effectiveness : two researchers screen ed all titles and abstracts and evaluate d study  quality in accordance with the  criteria described by guyatt et al.

programmes for antenatal screening  of hiv  the search did not identify any comparative studies on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for  hiv.   eight non -comparative studies [5 -12] analysed the effectiveness of antenatal hiv screening. the studies showed  that awareness of the hiv infection status is crucial for the prevention of mtct; reported mtct cases were mainly  associated with the mother’s un diagnosed hiv infection. the studies emphasised the importance of antenatal  screening for the prevention of mtct because a high proportion of pregnant women was only recogn ised as hiv  infected after prenatal testing.  in some regions, the number of neonatal  hiv infections did not decrease in women  at high  hiv risk who had tested hiv negative during early pregnancy (hiv tests were part of the routine check - up), which  warrant ed repeated testing during  late pregnancy. inclusion in antenatal care and provision o f  prevention therapies was mentioned as important for pregnant women who tested positive.   in sweden, a population -based analysis of data on all known mother –child pairs with p erinatal exposure to hiv -1  1982–2003 was conducted. a national screening program me offering hiv testing to all women regardless of risk  factors or ethnic origin has been in place  since 1987 and achieved  a high acceptance rate. screening combined  with mtct prevention measures (i.e. antiretroviral treatment and elective caesarean  delive ry) has resulted in a  significant decrease in the number of infected children; the mtct rate decreased from 24.7% in 1985 –1993 to  5.7% in 1994 –1998 and 0.6% in 1999 –2003. no child was infected when the mother received two or more  antiretroviral drugs [5].   a retrospective study of all hiv -infected women and their children (born  in denmark between january 2000 and  may 2005 ) showed that 21 % of the women did not know their hiv status at the beginning of the pregnancy. eight  children were born with hiv. they we re all born to mothers whose hiv infection was undiagnosed during  pregnancy or delivery [6].   in the netherlands, the effectiveness of antenatal hiv screening was evaluated by comparing the results from a   database on antenatal screening with the data from pregnant women and newborns from other data sources. 40%  of the hiv -infected women were only diagnosed during pregnancy. in 2004, the netherlands introduced universal  hiv screening with opt -out. prior to the introduction of the screening  scheme , 5–10 child ren with hiv were born   technical report  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility     9 every year , a number that dropped to one child per year on average after  the introduction  of hiv screening. there  were no known cases of mtct when women received  antiretroviral therapy  [7].  in alberta, canada, a retrospective analysi s was performed on hiv -infected pregnant women who delivered  between january 1999 and february 2006 ; 43% of hiv -infected pregnant women were unaware of their hiv  status prior to prenatal screening. only one  of the 111 infants born to hiv -positive mothers w as hiv i nfected; the  mother did not seek prenatal care [8].   in the us a, a significant reduction of perinatal hiv infections was achieved by routine hiv screening of pregnant  women and by mtct prevention measures; in 1991, an estimated 1  650 perinatal infec tions was reported; in 2002,  the numbers were down to between 144 and 236. in 2001,  the us centers for  disease control and prevention  recommended a routine second hiv test during the third trimester for women with an  elevated risk for hiv  infection because some regions showed an  increasing proportion of mtct in women who had tested hiv negative  earlier in pregnancy [9].    in new york state, the outcome  of an mtct prevention scheme (1988–2008) was assessed based on surveillance,  laboratory and programme monitoring data. in 1997, only half of the women received prenatal testing. since 2002,  at least 95% of pregnant women have been tested. the rate of mtct declined significantly in the same period of  time: 11.5% in 1997 ve rsus 1.3% in 2008. mtct was more likely in the infants of  mothers diagnosed with hiv at  or after delivery than in those whose mothers were diagnosed earlier and in infants whose mothers did not receive  any prenatal care [10]. us data on hiv -exposed singlet on deliveries in 1996 –2000 were used to study missed  opportunities for perinatal hiv prevention.  two major missed opportunities were observed: lack of prenatal care  and lack of prenatal hiv diagnosis despite prenatal care [11].   in a study in north carolina  conducted between  november 2002  and april 2005 , hiv rna testing was used for all  women who were antibody negative  at the time of r outine testing in order to determine the prevalence of acute  (antibody -negative ) hiv infection in pregnant women. a total of 0.2% of women tested positive, 3.4% of them had  acute hiv infections. one -third of the women with acute hiv infection were pregnant. during the study period, six  hiv-infected infants were reported ; three were born to women who were  antibody negative between 12 and  18 weeks of gestation [12].   eight studies [13 -23] compared the performance of several antenatal hiv screening strategies/policies in relation  to achieved coverage of screening programmes. generally, a  universal testing approach with opt -out strategy was  considered to be the most effective. however, some regions achieve d high testing rates among  pregnant women  by using an opt -in strategy.   in denmark, the effectiveness of selective hiv screening fo r the prevention of mtct was studied. in 1997, it was  recommended that women in high -risk groups should be offered hiv testing during pregnancy. in 2000 –2001,  three infants born to mother s in high -risk groups were vertically infected  – none of the mothers were offered an  hiv test  during pregnancy. it was concluded that selective screening for hiv during pregnancy was ineffective and  should be replaced by a universal offer of hiv testing [19].   a dutch study compared two antenatal hiv screening  strategies: non-selective opt -out and selective opt -in. hiv- infected pregnant women were retrospectively identified from the dutch hiv cohort 2000 –2008 data ; hiv-positive  infants were identified through  a questionnaire distributed to paediatric hiv centres. in 2004 , the selective opt -in  antenatal hiv screening strategy was replaced by a non -selective opt -out strategy. opt -out screening in  combination  with prevention interventions appeared to detect more hiv  infections in pregnant  women and reduce d  mtct substantially : before 2004 , only 33% of all hiv-infected pregnant women were diagnosed , while after  january 2004, 80% were diagnosed . no hiv -infected children were born to the hiv -infected women whose  infection was known before pregnancy or after t he first-trimester screenin g [13].   a study conducted in the uk analysed the effectiveness of universal antenatal screening  to reach the hiv -infected  pregnant women. universal antenatal screening was introduced in england in 1999. in scotland, some regions had  a policy of universal testing before 2003, and in mid -2003, the remaining regions implemented testing. the data  demonstrated that the universal offering has improved detection rates both in england and scotland. in england,  an estimated 12% of women remained undiagnosed at deli very in 2003 compared with 26% in 2000. in scotland,  11% of women remained undiagnosed at delivery in 2004 compared with 32% in 2000. the scottish data revealed  that an increasing proportion of women were having their infection diagnosed antenatally [17].   in catalonia, spain, where a policy of universal offer of hiv testing for pregnant women has been  implemented  since 1996, medical records showed an hiv testing uptake rate  of 88.3% in 2000 (94% in public and 71% in  private hospitals). study data  show that  prenatal hiv testing was frequently not documented in medical records  and that 10% of women were unaware that they had been  tested ; for 7.2% of the women who reported hiv  testing, this information was not found in the medical records. the main reason for n ot having had an hiv test was  not having been offered the test (65%) [20].    a study conducted in the us a and canada compared three different prenatal hiv -antibody testing approaches:  opt-in, opt -out voluntary testing of pregnant women , and mandatory newborn testing (the newborns are tested for  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   technical report   10 hiv with or without mother’s consent if the mother ’s hiv status is unknown at delivery). testing rates among  women who gave birth  varied depending on the approach: opt -out voluntary testing and ma ndatory testing of  newborns were associated with the highest testing rates. in regions using an opt-in approach , testing rates varied  between  25% and 81%, while regions using an opt-out policy reported  rates between  71% and 98%. shifting from  an opt -in app roach to either opt -out or mandatory newborn testing increased prenatal hiv -testing rates [14]. in  california , a 1996 law mandate s prenatal care providers to offer hiv test s to all pregnant woman. data from  population -based surveillance of 496 hiv -infected  women and their infants, collected between  1987 and 2002,  were analysed to compare the change in h iv test  offers before and after 1996. unsurprisingly, t here was a  significant increase in hiv test offers  for the period 1996−2002 : between  1987 and 1995, 53.2% of women giving  birth were offered an hiv test; between 1996 and 2002, the rate had climbed to 84.2% . all in all, 96.9% of  women with unknown hiv status accepted the hiv test [23].   a study conducted in ontario, canada by remis et al., showed that by implementing a policy to offer hiv  counselling  and testing to all pregnant women in 1999, increased the testing rate from 33% in 1999 to 96% in  2010. the policy recom mended an opt-in approach − hiv testing carried out with pre -test counsel ling and  informed consent [22]. the canadian  province of alberta  uses an  opt-out strategy for prenatal hiv screening. in  2002–2004, serum samples from women who opted -out were serologically tested for hiv. the proportion of  specimens from women who opted o ut of prenatal hiv testing was low and decreased from 4.3% in 2002 to 3.6%  in 2004. hiv seroprevalence among specimens from women who opted out was, however, 3.3 times higher than  the hiv seroprevalence among specimens from women who opted -in during the st udy period [21].   a canadian study by dorval et al. among women attending antenatal care clinics in 2005, recruited prior to their  first antenatal appointment, focused on how knowledge and attitudes regarding hiv and antenatal hiv screening  influence scree ning rates. most women  (92%) supported universal hiv screening in the prenatal period; 72 %  agreed with an opt-out policy , and 24 % preferred to opt -in. women accepting prenatal hiv screening were more  likely to be aware of the benefits of screening to reduc e the mtct rate [15].   a french study by jasseron et al. investigated whether mtct management and rate differed between african  immigrants and french -born hiv type 1 -infected women who gave birth  in france in 1984 –2007. the proportion of  african mothers among hiv type 1 -infected pregnancies increased from 11.8% in 1984 –1986 to 45.4% in 1996 – 1998 and 64.0% in 2002 –2004. a higher percentage of african women (40.6% ) discovered their infection during  pregnancy than  french -born mothers  (11.5% ); 7.6% of the afr ican women started antiretroviral  therapy after 32  weeks gestation (versus 4.1%  in french -born pregnant women ). late treatment initiation was associated with late  access to hiv diagnosis and prenatal care. the overall mtct rate among mothers receiving antiretroviral therapy   during pregnancy was 1.5% in 1997 –2004. the rate was higher in african (1.8%) than french -born women  (0.8%) [18].   data collected in italy by floridia et al. in 2001 –2006 also indicated that foreign -born women were less likely to be  aware of being hiv -infected before pregnancy ( 87.6%  versus 52.1%); they also  start antiretroviral treatment later   (week 14 versus week 7) than women of italian nationality. seven cases of mtct were observed (rate: 1.9%). the  two cases in non-italian women included one woman who was diagnosed after delivery and one woman diagnosed  at delivery. the five cases in italian women included four women who received treatment  with a ntiretroviral drugs   during pregnancy and one woman who receiv ed intra -partum tre atment only [16]. the authors pointed out  the  need for specific interventions to increase counselling and hiv testing rates in foreign women before they become  pregnant .   3.2.2 cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for  hiv  three cost -effectiveness anal yses from the 2000s were identified (table 1).   the c ost-effectiveness of universal antenatal screening depends directly on  the prevalence of hiv infection.  in a  2008 study, universal screening in amsterdam, the netherlands, was considered cost-effective i f the prevalence  was equal to, or higher than , 14 cases per 100 000  population  [24]; for australia , prevalence for cost -effectiveness   was needed to be at 4.37 cases per 100 000  population to reach c ost-effectiveness  [25]. a study from  new  zealand cited the willingness of policy makers  to pay for an additional life -year gained as an influence on decision s  with regard to  universal or selective screening  [26].   in the dutch study mentioned above,  universal screening for hiv infection s during pregnancy  was compared to no t  offering  screening at all [24]. the analysis was done from a healthcare  perspective . the study  estimated life years  gained (lyg) by avoiding infections in children , as well as the costs associated with screening and lifetime medical  costs of hiv -infected children. the study found systematic screening to be cost -effective as compared with no  screening all, based on a willingness -to-pay threshold value of 20 000 eur/lyg if the prevalence of hiv -infected  pregnant women was at least 14 cases per 100 000  population . the authors concluded that universal hiv  screening during pregnancy in amsterdam was justified and generate d significant net cost savings and health  benefits in most situations.   technical report  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility     11 in a 2004 australia n study , universal hiv scree ning during pregnancy was compared with the then-current practice  of testing only if the pregnant woman explicitly asked to be tested or was considered  to be at high risk [25]. the  cost-effectiveness of systematic screening was assessed by looking at the  likelihood of hiv infection among those  not screened. the study estimated additional life years  gained by mothers and children , the costs associated with  screening , and the lifetime medical costs for hiv -infected children. the value of one additional year o f life was  defined as the average income per capita multiplied by two. also taken into account were t he costs of an earlier  initiation of treatment for infected mothers and children and training costs for healthcare  personnel. universal hiv  screening was e stimated to be cost -effective in australia if the prevalence of hiv infection among unscreened  populations was between 0.0016% and 0.0106%. the authors concluded that universal screening would be cost - effective at a very low prevalence and would generate measurable benefits . they also  highlighted the need for  accurate statistics on prevalence.   an analysis from a healthcare point of view  compared universal hiv screening of pregnant women  in new zealand   with screening based on risk assessment [26]. in the analysis, treatment costs for mothers and children were  included ‘for a defined period after birth to a point when it was assumed that both mothers and babies would have  been identified regardless of a universal screening programme ’ [26].   the additional life years  gained by infected mothers with earlier initiation of treatment were also taken into  account. the results of this analysis compared favourably with cost -estimates per life year gained from simi lar  studies in other developed countries as well as to other healthcare  interventions in new zealand. the main factor  affecting the decision of whether to implement universal screening program mes in new zealand was hiv  prevalence in addition to the policy makers’ willingness to pay for an additional life -year gained.   table 1.  economic assessment of hiv screening

effectiveness of antenatal screening for hepatitis b, but  a total of six articles was found that dealt with  the effectiveness of hepatitis b screening. a further three articles  contained effectiven ess data.   the effectiveness of antenatal screening for the prevention of hepatitis b vertical transmission was shown to  depend on the prevalence of infection and the level of maternal viral load among pregnant women, as well as the  coverage of the screeni ng programme.   the effectiveness of antenatal screening for the prevention of perinatally transmitted hbv infection was assessed in  six italian regions in 2001. it was shown that 95% of all newborns of hbsag -positive  mothers were given active  and passive i mmunisation; all newborns  from foreign mothers  received active and passive immunisation . the  introduction of compulsory antenatal hbsag screening for pregnant women led to vastly  improved screening   adherence. three factors were observed to predict lack of compliance with screening: large family size, birth in a  private hospital , and immigration from a developing country. pregnant women from foreign countries with high  hbsag carrier rates were shown to be two  times  less likely to adhere to hbsag screening th an italian women.  supplementary efforts were suggested to improve the effectiveness of the programme among foreign -born  women  [27].   another italian study evaluated compliance with a protocol for  the prevention of perinatal hepatitis b infection in  public and private hospitals of 13 italian regions  between 2008 and 2009. prevalence of hbsag among pregnant  women varied between 0.4% (italian -born women ) and 3.44% (women born in e astern europe ); overall  prevalence was 0.86%. nearly 98% of pregnant women were screened and 100% of newborns from hbsag - positive mothers received immunoprophylaxis at birth. giving birth  in a public hospital or in hospitals located in  southern italy and being of foreign nationality  were predic tors of not being screened [28].   in denmark , selective screening missed 30 –50% of pregnant women in high -risk groups while opt -out screening  (introduc ed in 2005 ) led to a vaccination coverage of 96% among newborns of hbsag -positive  mothers, twice as  high a s before . the prevalence of hepatitis b in this study was 0.012% among women of danish origin and 2.74%  among foreign -born women. general screening prevented 8.4% cases of mother -to-child transmissions among  newborns from mothers who carried the hepatitis b virus  [29].  a study from ireland found that the uptake of hepatitis b screening was excellent : 99.98% of women presenting  for antenatal care accepted hepatitis b screening. screening revealed that in 87% of cases the hbv carrier status  was previously unk nown. the cost of screening equated gbp 1 013 per new diagnosis , which was considered to be  highly cost -effective considering the  morbidity and mortality associated with vertically transmitted hepatitis b.  selective screening would have missed a significan t number of those infected. opt -out screening was concluded to  be more appropriate than selective  screening , with the added advantage of being equitable and easy to  implement  [30].  in greece , the reasons for not complying with universal prenatal testing of hbsag were studied as there were  concerns that women with a higher disease burden may escape screening. universal mass vaccination combined  with improvements in socioeconomic and sanitary co nditions, as well as screening of blood donors, led to a  technical report  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility     13 significant decrease in hbv prevalence. a large influx  of immigrant s led to a shift in the epidemiology , with  immigrant women compris ing almost 20% of the child -bearing population in greece. the overall screening rate  was 91.3% in a nationwide study ; a hospital in athens serving a large population of refugees  reported a rate of  89.4%. pregnant  women who escaped hepatitis b screening were more likely to be chronically infected, deliver in a  public hosp ital, and be classified as ‘ illiterate immigrants ’. it was concluded that stepped -up surveillance,  immunisation programmes , and better access to routine screening was needed to effectively prevent mtct among  immigrant mothers [31].   norway is classified as a low -prevalence country for hepatitis b infection ; the prevalence of hepatitis b in pregnant  women is 0.1%. vaccination is targeted primarily at  risk groups. national guidelines recommend the screening of  immigrant s from high -prevalence countries, particu larly asylum seekers, but also  children adopted from abroad.  data regarding the uptake of testing and vaccination among these populations  are limited . the percentage of  mother -to-child transmission of registered routes of transmission was shown to be 0.2%. it was concluded that  universal screening should be introduced and that a universal vaccination strategy should be considered, given the  high cost o f reaching the target populations. the authors also recommend  that the surveillance system for hepatitis  b should be evaluated. in addition, screening effectiveness  should be assessed and immigrant populations should  receive vaccinations  [32].  since 1989 , the netherlands has screened all pregnant women for hbsag at their first visit to the obstetrician,  midwife or gp. a study from amsterdam, where hepatitis b prevalence is higher than in the rest of the netherlands,  found an increase of 91% to 97% in antena tal screening coverage during 1993 –1998.  the rate of hbsag positivity  was lowest (0.07%) among pregnant women from the netherlands antilles, low (0.07%) among native dutch  women , and highest (8.9%) among women from ghana. the amsterdam  enhanced screening p rogramme was  considered cheap and effective and was used to monitor the impact of neonatal immuni sation. the programme  included the analysis  of samples  in the public health laboratory , which then informed the municipal health services   if hbsag -positive  mothers needed  confirmatory testing. the e xpected delivery date was recorded  in a computer ised  system , and a public health nurse made sure that  hepatitis b immune globulin (hbig) was available.  within a week  the public health nurse verified that hbig was given and arranged for the first dose of vaccine to be administered  at home or in the  hospital; the second dose of vaccine was administered at a municipal health services  site [33]. it  was sugges ted that contact tracing and the vaccination of contacts of hbsag -positive  women should be integrated  into the hepatitis b antenatal screening programme after encouraging results in reducing the pool of infective  individuals among older children and adults  [34]. in 2008 , the antenatal hbsag prevalence for the netherlands was  0.33% , with 99.2% of the hbsag -positive  women being long -term carriers . the m ost frequently reported regions  of origin were asia (38%) and sub -saharan africa (23%). due to antenatal scr eening , an estimated number of 50   to 75 hbv infections in newborns could be  prevented annually [7].  3.3.2 cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for  hepatitis b   the literature search identified t hree cost -effectiveness analyses from the 1990s on hepati tis b screening (table 2).   two studies  were from an uk healthcare  perspective . prevalence rang ed from 0.083 % to 1.3% . the studies  compared universal screening of pregnant women with screening based on risk mapping [35,36]. both concluded  that the cost-effectiveness of universal screening was at an acceptable level  and recommended that screening   should be introduced . the s tudies highlighted that limiting screening to high -risk groups would lea ve a number of  maternal infections undetected and  lead to  the infection of  children. the most important assumptions that affected  the results of the sensitivity analyses were infection prevalence, the cost of screening tests , and the likelihood of  transmission.   a study from the belgian healthcare  perspective com pared universal screening with no screening at all. p revalence  at the time of the study was 0.67% . [37]. the cost -effectiveness of universal screening was comparable to other  generally accepted medical procedures. screening all pregnant women and vaccinati ng all neonates at risk was not  considered cost -saving. the main assumptions influencing the results of the sensitivity analyses were the  prevalence of infection, screening and vaccination costs, and discount rate.   effectiveness

-effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility     15 3.4 syphilis   3.4.1 effectiveness of antenatal screening for  syphilis   the literature search did not identify any comparative studies on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for   syphilis , but five articles reporting on the effectiveness of syphilis screening were identified. a further five articles  were include d from other searches. screening proved to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e. stillbirth and  perinatal death) and although  women from country -specific high -risk groups were found to be affected by higher  rates of syphilis during pregnancy, a universal  antenatal screening policy was considered effective and ethically  appropriate.   a 2006 study from the  united kingdom cited three major risk factors for infectious syphilis in pregnant women  included: living in london and the south east, belonging to an et hnic minority group , and having been born  abroad. antenatal screening was performed  routine ly, but there were no national data on the number of cases of  syphilis diagnosed during  pregnancy ; also lacking were data  on the rate of congenital syphilis.  the stu dy called  for  robust national surveillance of syphilis in pregnan t women and the identification and recording of  cases of  congenital syphilis [38].   in the united states, syphilis was found to be most common in non-white women below  30 years of age , with little  education and low income. women with syphilis were more likely to have late or no prenatal care. women at high  risk or in high -prevalence areas were recommended to be screened a second time in the third trimester [39].   an austrian study d ocument ed the development of syphilis and analyse d the effectiveness of antenatal syphilis  screening practices  in austria . in austria, the i ncidence of syphilis had declined , and the geographical variation was  large. in metropolitan vienna, the incidence was 12 time s higher than in the federal provinces , which are mainly   rural in character. the cost of screening in rural areas was four times higher than the potential savings .  calculations suggest ed that universal syphilis screening in pregnancy was not justified. the authors recommended  that consideration should be given to replace general screening with targeted screening for high-risk groups  [40].   in a 2011 systematic review of literature, three outcomes were assessed to examine evidence for  the effectiveness  of interventions: increased uptake of syphilis testing, increased treatment rates , and reduction in adverse  pregnancy outcomes. ten studies with interventions to improve outcomes of antenatal syphilis screening  were  included . the studies did not allow for the assessment of the ideal time for syphilis screening. the  included studies  did not provide sufficient information on the outcomes of partner treatment ; also lacking was sufficient information  on repeat screening s during  the third trimester to reduce the risk of reinfection. delayed treatment of syphilis in  pregnancy increased the likelihood of congenital syphilis. screening was found to reduce adverse pregnancy  outcomes, particularly rates of stillbirth and perinatal death [41].  in switzerland , antenatal screening for syphilis was not generally recommended; it was discontinued during the  1990s. notifiability of syphilis infections was restored in 1999 due to increasing incidence rate s. from 2006 to  2009, infectious syphil is cases in women of childbearing age  increase d substantially . improvement s in prenatal care  and syphilis programmes ware recommended [42].   a who analysis of global and regional estimates of syphilis in pregnancy and adverse outcomes was performed for  2008 data. syphilis seropositivity among antenatal care attendees in europe was reported to be 0.16% . the  analysis included only a few countries for which data reported through the hiv universal access system  were  available . it was recommended that all countri es should collect data on at least three indicators of mtct of  syphilis: proportion of antenatal care attendees that are tested for syphilis, proportion of seropositive attendees,  and proportion of seropositives that are adequately treated. it was conclude d that all countries should scale up the  screening and treatment for syphilis in pregnancy [43].   in 1999, the  compulsory notification of syphilis came to an end in the netherlands . since then there had been no  nationwide registration system for the monitor ing of congenital syphilis. acceptance of syphilis screening tests was  high; tests were only refused between one and four  times a year. congenital syphilis was diagnosed in fewer than  five newborns per year ; in all cases the mothers belonged to vulnerable groups (illegal immigrants or drug users).  it was estimated that 10 cases of syphilis in newborns were prevented by screening. universal screening was  considered simpler and more acceptable than a programme only focused on risk groups [7].   a prospective it alian study from 2006 –2007 found the maternal syphilis seroprevalence at delivery to be 0.17%.  most seropositive mothers were born outside italy, but foreign origin was not associated with a worse neonatal  outcome. congenital syphilis was diagnosed in 20/1 00 000 live births. maternal risk factors included young age  (<20), no antenatal care , and no adequate treatment. the authors did not observe any  association with marital  status, unemployment, previous syphilis diagnosis or coexistence of other maternal infections. the majority of  infants born to seropositive mothers was delivered in northern italian hospitals from immigrant mothers mostly  from eastern europe. a total of 25% of itali an mothers had no antenatal syphilis screening versus 12% of  immigrant women [44].   effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   technical report   16 in a uk study from the late 1990s, switching to target ed surveillance or even stopping antenatal screening for   syphilis was observed to save relatively little money. three groups of pregnant women were identified as potentia l  target groups : pregnant women in the thames region, women belonging to non-white ethnic groups , and women   born outside the united kingdom. selective screening by country of birth or ethnic group would d etect at least  70% of cases ; targeting by region would also be effective , but u p to 30% of cases would still be missed. in  addition, selective screening would cause ethical and medico -legal problems and be politically and practically  difficult. medico -legal costs could be associated with failure to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths and illness resulting  from congenital infection because of missed cases. targeted screening runs the risk of missing newly developing  risk groups and unexpected increases  in transmission [45].   in an article  without primary data, the authors advocated a priority listing for scaling up control over sexually  transmitted infections other than hiv/aids . the strengthening of p artner notification s was also considered  necessary , which wo uld improve  case finding, would prevent re -infection from an existing partner , and could  interrupt the onward transmission in a sexual network [46].   3.4.2 cost -effectiveness of antenatal syphilis screening   two cost -effectiveness analyses were identified for the syphilis review (table 3).   a literature search on economic evaluations of syphilis screening  retrieved  a cost -effectiveness analysis from a  healthcare perspective  (late 1990 s, united kingdom ) [45] an d a cost–benefit  analysis using the societal point of  view from (early 1980s , norway [47] (table 3). both recommended that syphilis screening in early pregnancy  should be continued.   the uk study [45] compared systematic screening for syphilis in early pre gnancy to other more limited screening  options. the consequences of infection transmission to the child (impact on life expectancy, treatment and other  costs) were not estimated. the study found that direct costs for the limited screening options were lower, but only  70 to 77% of infected mothers would be identified , i.e. several children would be infected each year. limiting  screening would also bring ethical, legal, practical and political problems. for these reasons and due to the  changing international syphilis prevalence, it was recommended that systematic screening during pregnancy  should  be implemented .   in the norwegian study [47], systematic screening for syphilis in early pregnancy was compared to no screening  at  all. screening was estimated to ave rt costs caused by infections in children  (i.e. treatment, special education,  residential care and loss of earnings), and the achieved cost savings were almost four times higher than the costs  incurred by the yearly screening program me. continuation of the  screening was recommended.   a who study modelling the costs and cost -effectiveness of screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy  was published when this report was almost  finalised. it modelled screening in eight generic country scenarios and  conclude d that congenital syphilis could be eliminated through an expanded screening and treatment program me  in antenatal care facilities . this would be cost saving in high -prevalence settings where prevalence of a reactive  syphilis serological test in pregnancy is 3%. in the low -prevalence scenarios , the cost per daly (disability -adjusted  life year ) averted ranged from usd 24 to usd 111; the authors conclude d that according to the who standards  this would be cost -effective  [48].   technical report  effectiveness and

rubella susceptibility   3.5.1 effectiveness of antenatal screening for  rubella susceptibility   the literature search did not identify any comparative studies on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for   rubella susceptibility. however, seven descriptive studies concerning the effectiveness of rubella susceptibility  screening were identified.   in some countries with high vaccination coverage and low rubella incidence, antenatal screening  of rubella  susceptibility has been discontinued. however, subnational areas and risk groups remain where antenatal screening  for rubella susceptibility is still considered necess ary [49].    three uk studies assess ed the  effectiveness of rubella susceptibility screening. in a study from london, a high  screening rate of over 90% for rubella susceptibility was found , with an overall rubella susceptibility of 3.6%.  however, in some are as of london the susceptibility rates were considerably higher (14.3%), which was  understood to reflect the ethnic diversity of these areas [50]. in a study conducted by the national health service  (nhs) blood and transplant , a large number of samples from antenatal women  was screened during routine  checks. the nhs study  identified two predictors of low levels of rubella antibodies : birth cohorts born after 1990  and ethnicity  [51]. a significant increase in those with low leve ls of rubella antibodies (< 10iu/ml) was observed in  another uk study.  a changing pattern of rubella seronegativity and susceptibility in pregnant women born before  and after 1983 was observed. it was found difficult to obtain accurate figures for uptake f or postpartum  immun isation rates because there was no requirement to notify adult measles, mumps and rubella (mmr)  vaccinations to a recording authority [52].   in ireland , researchers  concluded that  in order  to prevent congenital rubella syndrome (crs) heal th services  should focus on women who are young, nulliparous , and born outside the eu. the increased rate of rubella  seronegativity in the general population in 2009 was associated with an increase in migration. the study also found  that it would be cost -effective to focus screening on this easily identifiable group. also , vaccinations without  serological testing for women from countries without rubella programmes could be cost -effective [53].   effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   technical report   18 in a canadian study from quebec,  in-hospital postpartum vaccinat ion was found to be an effective means of  vaccinating groups at risk. misconceptions about vaccine use were noted that affected timely administration and  led to missed opportunities [54].   in italy , free serological testing for rubella susceptibility has b een part of the standard pregnancy care since 1995.  a study on congenital infections from the campania region found that no s ystematic process and outcome  monitoring was implemented . standard s of care were unequal , possibly excluding low -income pregnant wo men  with poor or no antenatal care. the dramatic rise in congenital rubella and rubella incidence during pregnancy in  2008 might have been a consequence of the vaccination campaigns for children in 2004 –2007 that were carried  out without  conducting  a catch -up campaign to vaccinate susceptible women of childbearing age. congenital  rubella was found to be an issue since all but one case were found in native -born mothers.  actions to reduce the  gap between children and adult vaccination coverage were recommended [55]. the goals of the national program  to eradicate measles and congenital rubella (pnem) in italy were to reduce and limit the occurrence of crs to less  than one case per 100  000 live births ( fewer  than five cases per year), to reach 95% vacc ination coverage in  paediatric age , and to have less than 5% of pregnant women susceptible to rubella. the proportion of women  found to be at risk of rubella infection was 14.2%. the highest risk rate was found in women in the 15 –25-year-old  group (24.7%) ; 33.8% of susceptible women had been pregnant at least once before. vaccination was  recommended to be performed before discharge. a high proportion of women was observed to be unaware of the  risk posed by rubella infection during pregnancy (36%) [56].   3.5.2 cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for  rubella  susceptibility   only one cost -effectiveness analysis about rubella susceptibility screening was identified in the literature search  (table 4).   the dutch cost -utility analysis from 2010 [49] compared s creening non -vaccinated pregnant women in the low- vaccination -coverage regions (lvr), screening all pregnant women in lvr , and screening all non -vaccinated  pregnant women in the country. the calculations were based on the 2004 –2005 rubella epidemic in the  netherlands, and costs were calculated separately for epidemic and non -epidemic years. screening pregnant  women for rubella antibodies was found cost -effective if targeted at unvaccinated women in lvr in the  netherlands. screening all pregnant women in lvr  or screening all non -vaccinated pregnant women in the  netherlands was cost-effective if cost savings due to avoided treatment costs for prevented complications were  lifelong.   table 4.  economic assessment of rubella screening for susceptibility during pre gnancy   publication (country)  comparator  type of analysis,  perspective,

in general descriptive and did not include a comparison group and were thus judged to be of  low quality [1].   technical report  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility     19 the three studies on the cost -effectiveness of hiv screening [24 -26] were of high quality (table 5). they fulfilled  all [24], 9/10 [25] or 8/10 [26] of the 10 criteria for program me cost-effectiveness studies  (see drummond and  jefferson [2] ). the description of the comparator (ordinary c are) was not described in full detail in the two latter  studies  [24,25] , and bramley et al. [26] had not reported capital costs of the program me. these omissions were  judged not to impact on the validity of the conclusions.   cost-effectiveness studies on s creening for hepatitis b [35 -37] were of high quality, fulfilling at least 7 of the 10  drummond criteria [2] (table 5). none of the studies discussed general isability with regard to  other settings or  presented an incremental analysis, and only one [37] use d discounting in presenting the effects. these omissions  were judged not to impact on the validity of the conclusions.  two of the cost -effectiveness studies [45,48] fulfilled  all drummond criteria and were thus of high quality (table 5). stray -pedersen [47 ] failed to conduct incremental  and sensitivity analyses, and the conclusions were based on calculated net benefit rather than cost –effectiveness  ratio, but the quality of the study was still  considered to be high.   the cost –utility study on rubella suscept ibility screening  fulfilled all drummond criteria [2] (table 5).   table 5. quality assessment of the selected publications based on the drummond criteria for  economic evaluations    hiv hepatitis b  syphilis  rubella   quality

effectiveness of antenatal screening for each of the target infections depends primarily on the coverage of the  screening program me, the quality of testing, and the effectiveness of treatment. in addition to these factors, cost - effectiveness is influenced by the prevalence of these infections among pregnant women, the cost of the screening  program me, and the practice/policy that the screening is compared with. program me costs depend mainly of the  cost of administering  and analysing the screening /confirmatory tests, the type of healthcare  personnel and their  time, cost of medication and other necessary treatment, and patient compliance.   coverage and compliance with a un iversal screening policy can be enhanced by increasing the level of awareness  through  public information ; enhancing provider awareness ; improved  access to testing, treatment and follow -up;  and allocation of adequate resources [55]. screening is usually only provided once  (in the early stages  of  pregnancy ). a second screening late during the  pregnancy is highly unlikely to be cost -effective , especially in  countries with relatively low incidence of hiv, hbv and syphilis. in general , universal screening is con sidered  simpler and more acceptable than a programme which  focuse s on risk groups [7].    4.1 limitations   the literature review for effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening  was limited to publications in  english or nordic languages. overa ll linguistic bias was low as  only 29  (3%) of the 981 identified publications were  excluded because of  language restrictions. references to documents in other languages were preserved  (but are  not yet translated)  in the source material  for this project for potential future use.   the literature review on the cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening found relatively few relevant articles ( three  on hiv, three on hepatitis b, two on  syphilis and one for rubella susceptibility). this emphas ises the fact that   antenatal screening for  infectious diseases has rarely been  assessed for cost effectiveness in an evidence -based  manner . it also shows the need for an assessment of the existing practices. the scope of the literature search was  broadened  because the autho rs of this report felt that making  recommendations based on only nine articles (and  data collected from the survey) was inadequate. this allowed for the review  of cost-independent factors of  effectiveness at the operational level. the expanded search resul ted in the inclusion of 19 additional articles on  hiv, six on  hepatitis b, five on  syphilis and seven  on rubella susceptibility screening , which provided helpful  background information for the development of  a future guidance  document .   literature review s depend on the quality of search strategies and on the ability to identify  all relevant articles that  address the questions under review. screening the search results for relevance always involves a degree of  subjectiv ity, even when performed in accordance  with predefined inclusion criteria. the selection of articles  followed predefined steps and was always carried out  by two persons who initially worked independently. several  search strategies were tested in the various databases, and  the final search strategies were decided upon when no  additional significant publications could be  retrieved  by further modification s to the algorithms.   it was particularly difficult for the project to comprehensively identify grey literature (reports and other types of  public ations not indexed in databases) , even i f published in  english or one of the nordic languages. ancestry  searches were used to identify such materials . although this approach provide d a few additional publications , it is  likely that some relevant materials may have been missed .      effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for hiv, hepatitis b, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   technical report   22 5 conclusions   with regard to  hiv, hepatitis b and syphilis, most studies suggest that comprehensive , population -based antenatal  screening is cost -effective in all european settings where this has been researched .  in the end, any judgement on cost effectiveness will be  a value judgement. judging whether a preventive  programme is cost -effective is highly dependent on the thresholds set for the cost per life years  (or other health  metric s used) that can be saved, unless it can be sho wn that the programme actually is saving  costs. this figure  (which describes how much has to be invested in a  program/intervention per year and for every  life year  saved)  will vary between countries , depending on multiple factors that cannot be determined by any other authority than  national policymakers  because every country needs to prioritise its health investments in accordance with national  needs. what is considered as ‘t olerable costs ’ varies widely in europe and can be somewhere between thousands  and hundreds of thousands of euros per life year saved. in addition, comparisons of costs and cost -effectiveness  thresholds are notoriously difficult  between countries and systems, if not impossible, due to t he heterogen eity of  healthcare  systems and the diff erent approaches employed in the antenatal screening for infections.   the effectiveness of antenatal screening depends on the coverage of the screening program me, the quality of  testing, and the effectiveness of treatment. the ability to reach all pregnant women, the sensitivity of the  screening test (i.e. the  capacity to identify all infected women ), and the preventi ve treatment received by all  infected pregnant women are factors that influence  effectiveness.   in order to assess the  performance (effectiveness) of antenatal screening for infections, it is essential to have  comprehensive surveillance systems in place that accurate ly record prevention failures (i.e. the transmission of hiv,  hepatitis b, syphilis or rubella from the moth er to the child) and document  the targets  and indicators of all  screening programme s. ideally, surveillance  systems record information from infected mothers and their children  (in an attempt to identify risk factors for mtct ), document mtct rates, identify  targets and indicators , and point  toward  opportunities for improvement of antenatal screening and care.   6 next steps   the results of this literature review will serve as a basis for an ecdc guidance document on strengthening  antenatal screening programme s in the eu/eea member states.      technical report  effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for
