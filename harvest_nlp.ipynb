In the case of rubella, \\nsusceptible mothers are identified.  \\nEffectiveness of antenatal screening as prevention  As above, but extended to the factors influencing the \\nimplementation of measures to prevent the infection  of the \\nchild by vertical (i.e. mother -to-child) transmission at any \\nstage of pregnancy or during infancy and/or breastfeeding.  \\nOperational effectiveness  Provides information on how well the intended programmatic \\nmeasures (e.g. screening and interventions)  are implemented \\nin terms of coverage, specificity, quality and necessary follow -\\nup with regard to the targeted population.  \\nInfant  A child of less than 12 months of age.  \\nMigrant  In this document,  the term ‘migrant’ is used in its widest \\nsense to embrace a number of population groups mentioned \\nin the literature.  \\nMother -to-child transmission  Transmission of an infectious agent from the mother to the \\nchild before birth, during labour and delivery, or during \\ninfancy (the first year of life). Also referred to a s vertical \\ntransmission.  \\nMandatory screening  Systematic testing at the population level, without the real \\npossibility of declining the test, or a test that is taken as a \\ncondition to gain access to care, benefits, services, or any \\nform of application of in dividual rights (i.e. travel, schooling, \\nday care, employment, etc.). Declining the screening test may \\nlead to sanctions or restrictions of individual civil rights.  \\nNewborn  A child less than one month of age.  \\nNeonatal  Of, relating to, or affecting the newb orn and the infant during \\nthe first month after birth.  \\nDiagnostic testing  A test in order to identify a health condition of the individual, \\nadministered with the explicit intention of clinically managing \\nthe condition.  \\nOpt-in testing  Individuals seeking ca re are informed that testing is \\nrecommended. The individual is required to give explicit \\nconsent before the test is performed.  \\nOpt-out testing  Testing is performed as part of routine care. Pre -test \\ninformation is made available, and consent is assumed unle ss \\nthe individual explicitly declines testing.  \\nRubella susceptibility  Lack of protective antibodies for rubella virus. Protective \\nantibodies can result from natural infection or vaccination.  \\nUniversal screening  Testing systematically offered to the entire relevant \\npopulation (mandatory or voluntary); covers opt -in and opt -\\nout testing.  \\nPrenatal  Before birth; during or relating to pregnancy (synonym for \\nantenatal).  \\nRecommendation  Suggestion or proposal by an authoritative body.   TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  vii Screening  The systematic applic ation of tests, examinations, or other \\nprocedures (in the context of this report, testing for HIV, \\nhepatitis B, syphilis infection or susceptibility for rubella \\ninfection), with the intention of identifying previously \\nunrecognised health conditions at the population level. The \\nrelevant population is dependent on the condition to be \\nidentified and the intended interventions and must be \\ndefined.  \\nSelective screening  Testing systematically offered to the entire relevant \\npopulation (mandatory or voluntary), cove rs both opt -in and \\nopt-out testing.  \\nUniversal screening  The entire relevant population are systematically offered \\ntesting (mandatory or voluntary), covers both opt -in and opt -\\nout testing.  \\nVoluntary screening  Testing systematically offered to the entire rel evant \\npopulation whereby refusal does not lead to immediate \\nnegative consequences, restrictions of civil rights or sanctions \\nfor the individual belonging to that population.  \\nVulnerable populations  For the purpose of this guidance, subpopulation groups that  \\nare at increased risk of contracting HIV, HBV, syphilis or \\nrubella during pregnancy or are already infected, and are \\nhard to reach through antenatal screening programmes.  \\n  TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n1 Executive summary  \\nBackground  \\nThis literature review of the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening was conducted as part of a \\nproject evaluat ing the effectiveness of antenatal screening (ANS) for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella \\nsusceptibility in EU/EEA Member States. The purpose of this review was to provide evidence for guidance to \\nstrengthen antenatal screening programmes in Europe.  \\nMethods  \\nThe effectiveness of antenatal screening was defined as those factors that influenc e the population completeness \\nwith regard to the detection of infections during pregnancy  and factors that could potentially lead to mother -to-\\nchild transmission (MTCT ). In the case of rubella, this refers to the identification of susceptible mothers.  \\nThe cost -effectiveness of ANS was not defined because  defining the cost-effectiveness of a preventive intervention \\nis in many ways a  value judgement, as the acceptable cos t per prevented outcome/gained life year (adjusted or \\nunadjusted) depend s on a comparative valuation of different diseases and the economic situation of the country \\nfunding the intervention .  \\nThe research question was formulated to include  the following  elements (based on a PICO (T) elements) :  \\n\\uf0b7 P (population) : pregnant women and their unborn children  \\n\\uf0b7 I (intervention) : national programmes  for universal screening  \\n\\uf0b7 C (comparator) : no screening or screening for high risk groups only  \\n\\uf0b7 O (outcome) : avoided infecti ons in children and cost per infection avoided  \\n\\uf0b7 T (time factor ): from maternal screening to confirmation of the child’s infection status.  \\nDatabase  searches were performed between 13 October 2011 and 12 March 2014 and covered all EU/EEA \\ncountries, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand ; search languages were  English, Danish, Finnish, German, \\nNorwegian and Swedish.  \\nThe literature was screened by two independent researchers ; studies were selected based on the agreed inclusion \\ncriteria. The study quality wa s assessed in accordance with  the criteria described by Guyatt et al. [1] \\n(effectiveness ) and by Drummond et al. [2] (economic evaluations ).  \\nResults  \\nThis literature r eview on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella \\nsusceptibility retrieved nine studies on cost -effectiveness and 37 studies on effectiveness that were included in the \\nanalysis.  \\nThe effectiveness of antenatal screening depends on the coverage of the screening program me, the quality of \\ntesting, and the effectiveness of treatment. The ability to reach all pregnant women, the sensitivity of the \\nscreening test (i.e. the capacity to identify all infected women ), and the preventive  treatment received by all \\ninfected pregnant women were factors to ensure optimal effectiveness.  \\nThe following n ational antenatal screening programmes were considered cost -effective in comparison with no \\nscreening or screening only targeted risk groups: syphilis in Norway and the United Kingdom; HIV in the \\nNetherlands, Australia and New Zealand; hepatitis B in the United Kingdom and Belgium ; rubella susceptibility in \\nthe Netherlands, especially if targeted at non -vaccinated pregnant women.  \\nThis review also showed that only a small number of cost-effectiveness studies has been conducted in Europe.  \\nConclusions  \\nFor HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis, most studies suggest that comprehensive, population -based antenatal screening is \\ncost effective in al l assessed  settings.  \\nThe e ffectiveness of antenatal screening programmes  has not been widely studied in Europe. The available \\nliterature mainly provide s authors ’ opinions regarding factors that influenc e effectiveness ; there are no  comparative \\nstudies on effectiveness . Implementing antenatal screening programmes was found to be cost -effective in several \\ncountries.  \\n   Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n2 1 Background  \\nIn 2011, ECDC initiated a project to evaluate the effectiveness of antenatal screening programmes for HIV, \\nhepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility in the EU/EEA.  \\nThe project included: 1) a survey of the EU/EEA Member States to obtain information on the current practice s of \\nantenatal screening for infectious diseases in order to describe country -specific approaches and iden tify areas in \\nneed for improvement and models of good practice [3]; 2) a literature review of the published literature on \\neffectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening.  \\nThe aim of the systematic literature reviews was to collect published ev idence on the effectiveness and cost -\\neffectiveness of antenatal screening practices for the prevention of mother -to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, \\nhepatitis B, syphilis and rubella in the EU/EEA countries in order to inform ECDC guidance on antenatal sc reening \\nin the EU/EEA.  \\n2 Review methods  \\n2.1 Search strategy  \\nInformation specialists conducted a systematic literature search on the cost -effectiveness and effectiveness of \\nscreening programmes for the target ed infections during pregnancy (Appendi ces 1 and 2). The search strategies \\nwere developed by experienced information specialists in collaboration with content experts on the basis of the \\nresearch question (PICO : population, intervention, comparison and outcome/s ) to retrieve relevant studies. \\nA combina tion of medical headings and keywords was used to search title s and abstract s. The results were \\ncombined to exclude duplicates. All reviews were developed by senior information specialists  and content experts.  \\n2.1.1 Cost -effectiveness  \\nResearch question: A re national programmes  for universal antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and \\nrubella susceptibility cost -effective?  \\nThe following PICO (T) elements were identified  for a cost -effectiveness review : \\n\\uf0b7 P (population): pregnant women and their unborn children  \\n\\uf0b7 I (intervention): national universal screening  programmes  for all pregnant women for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis \\nB and rubella susceptibility; therapeutic intervention for those with positive test results (rubella \\nsusceptibility, vaccination to prevent MTCT in future pregnancies)  \\n\\uf0b7 C (comparator, reference intervention): no screening or screening for high -risk groups only  \\n\\uf0b7 O (outcome): avoided infections in children and cost per infection avoided  \\n\\uf0b7 T (time factor ): from maternal screening sample to co nfirmation of the child\\'s infection status.  \\nAfter a discussion with experts, it was decided that life years gained (LYG), life years saved (LYS), and incremental \\ncost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were also outcomes of interest. As outcome terms were not  used in the searches, \\nthis addition s would not have had any effect on the search.  \\nThe references of all included articles were checked for relevant new articles (ancestry search). In October 2011, \\na comprehensive search on the economic evaluation of screening programmes  for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B was \\ncarried out in the following databases , starting with the publication year 1990 : Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE  \\nDaily Update, Ovid MEDLINE In -Proces s & Other Non -Indexed Citations, NLM PubMed (epubs ahead of print), the \\nCentre for Reviews and Dissemination, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central \\nRegister of Controlled Trials.  \\nInformation concerning cost -effectiveness wa s derived from a systematic literature review on economic evaluations \\nof antenatal screening for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B commissioned by  the Finnish Institute for Health and \\nWelfare [4] in October 2011 (updated in October 2012) . A review of economic  evaluations of rubella susceptibility \\nscreening was carried out using a similar strategy  in October 2012 . Both searches were updated in January 2014. \\nThe search strategies and results are presented in Appendix 1. Grey literature from was not included.  \\n2.1.2 Effectiveness  \\nResearch question: Are national programmes  for universal antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and \\nrubella susceptibility effective , and what are the factors influencing effectiveness?  \\nThe search strategy was based on a  cost-effectiveness  search , but the term ‘ cost’ or its synonyms were not used \\nas search term s. The time period searched ranged from 2000 to the present ; the selected databases were the  TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  3 same as for the cost -effectiveness search  described above . The HIV search was limited to EU/EEA countries, the  \\nUSA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. A second search on ANS effectiveness was conducted on March 2014 in \\nOvid MEDLINE to ensure that no important studies were missed (the previous search was limited  to publications \\nreporting  on the cost of screening programmes ). The search strategies and results are presented in Appendix 2. \\nGrey literature was not included.  \\nThe literature review on cost -effectiveness was based was on the following PICO (T) elements:   \\n\\uf0b7 P (population): pregnant women and their unborn children;  \\n\\uf0b7 I (intervention): national universal screening  programmes  for all pregnant women for syphilis, HIV, \\nhepatitis  B and for rubella susceptibility; therapeutic intervention for those with positive test results (rubella \\nsusceptibility, vaccination to prevent MTCT in future pregnancies)  \\n\\uf0b7 C (comparison): no screening or screening for high risk groups only  \\n\\uf0b7 O (outcome): avoided infections in children  \\n2.2 Study selection criteria and procedure  \\nThe searches we re targeted to cost -effectiveness and  effectiveness  of screening , with the aim of finding relevant \\nevaluations of antenatal screening program mes. Articles describing solely sensitivity and specificity of different \\ntests used for screening were not included  because these usually do not provide enough information about test \\nperformance in real -world settings. We used data from high -quality screening program evaluations, as assessed \\nusing the criteria by Drummond et al. [2] for cost -effectiveness studies and b y Guyatt et al. [1] for effectiveness \\nstudies.   \\nThe exclusion criteria for the cost -effectiveness search were:  \\n\\uf0b7 No cost  information  \\n\\uf0b7 Incorrect infection  \\n\\uf0b7 No intervention (e.g. prevalence study)  \\n\\uf0b7 Intervention not in line with current practice  \\n\\uf0b7 Description or comparison of laboratory methods or diagnostics only  \\n\\uf0b7 Language not English, Danish, Finnish, German, Norwegian or Swedish  \\nOther reasons for exclusion  were: wrong study design, health service utilisation, treatment, ethical or legal issues, \\nsocio-demographic  issues, attitudes, prognosis, and education . \\nThe exclusion criteria for the effectiveness search were:  \\n\\uf0b7 Publication type without original data (editorial, letter , etc.) \\n\\uf0b7 Country not EU, USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand  \\n\\uf0b7 Not national data (regional, only one city , etc.) \\n\\uf0b7 Population not pregnant women  \\n\\uf0b7 No intervention (e.g. prevalence study)  \\n\\uf0b7 Intervention not in line with current practice  \\n\\uf0b7 Description or comparison of laboratory methods or diagnostics only  \\n\\uf0b7 Language not English, Danish, Finnish, German, Norwegian or Swedish  \\n\\uf0b7 Other (e.g. treatment, case description)  \\n2.2.1 Cost -effectiveness  \\nTwo researchers independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles and selected potentially \\nrelevant articles based on  agreed exclusion criteria.  Differing choices were discussed and doubtful cases were \\nincluded.  \\nIn the second round, the same researchers evaluated the full-text versions of potentially relevant publications using \\nmore detailed inclusion criteria. The given c osts had to include scre ening costs as well as counselling and \\ntreatment  costs; in addition, the articles had to mention the infections in children . Disease -specific selection criteria \\nwere clarified in discussion with infection experts: for syphilis, testing and treatment should  be completed in early \\npregnancy, and in the case of HIV, highly active antiretroviral therapy should be initiated no later than at 28 weeks \\nof gestation. The final selection of included publications was made by consensus. In order to find more cost –\\nbenefi t analyses, the r eference s/bibliographies  of all selected articles were search ed for material s published before \\nthe search  date. \\nTwo researchers independently assessed s tudy quality with the Drummond checklist (economic evaluation ) [2]; \\ndisagreements were resolved by a third researcher .

HIV  \\n3.2.1 Effectiveness of national programmes for antenatal screening \\nof HIV \\nThe search did not identify any comparative studies on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for  HIV.  \\nEight non -comparative studies [5 -12] analysed the effectiveness of antenatal HIV screening. The studies showed \\nthat awareness of the HIV infection status is crucial for the prevention of MTCT; reported MTCT cases were mainly \\nassociated with the mother’s un diagnosed HIV infection. The studies emphasised the importance of antenatal \\nscreening for the prevention of MTCT because a high proportion of pregnant women was only recogn ised as HIV \\ninfected after prenatal testing.  In some regions, the number of neonatal  HIV infections did not decrease in women \\nat high  HIV risk who had tested HIV negative during early pregnancy (HIV tests were part of the routine check -\\nup), which  warrant ed repeated testing during  late pregnancy. Inclusion in antenatal care and provision o f \\nprevention therapies was mentioned as important for pregnant women who tested positive.  \\nIn Sweden, a population -based analysis of data on all known mother –child pairs with p erinatal exposure to HIV -1 \\n1982–2003 was conducted. A national screening program me offering HIV testing to all women regardless of risk \\nfactors or ethnic origin has been in place  since 1987 and achieved  a high acceptance rate. Screening combined \\nwith MTCT prevention measures (i.e. antiretroviral treatment and elective caesarean  delive ry) has resulted in a \\nsignificant decrease in the number of infected children; the MTCT rate decreased from 24.7% in 1985 –1993 to \\n5.7% in 1994 –1998 and 0.6% in 1999 –2003. No child was infected when the mother received two or more \\nantiretroviral drugs [5].  \\nA retrospective study of all HIV -infected women and their children (born  in Denmark between January 2000 and \\nMay 2005 ) showed that 21 % of the women did not know their HIV status at the beginning of the pregnancy. Eight \\nchildren were born with HIV. They we re all born to mothers whose HIV infection was undiagnosed during \\npregnancy or delivery [6].  \\nIn the Netherlands, the effectiveness of antenatal HIV screening was evaluated by comparing the results from a  \\ndatabase on antenatal screening with the data from pregnant women and newborns from other data sources. 40% \\nof the HIV -infected women were only diagnosed during pregnancy. In 2004, the Netherlands introduced universal \\nHIV screening with opt -out. Prior to the introduction of the screening  scheme , 5–10 child ren with HIV were born \\n TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  9 every year , a number that dropped to one child per year on average after  the introduction  of HIV screening. There \\nwere no known cases of MTCT when women received  antiretroviral therapy  [7]. \\nIn Alberta, Canada, a retrospective analysi s was performed on HIV -infected pregnant women who delivered \\nbetween January 1999 and February 2006 ; 43% of HIV -infected pregnant women were unaware of their HIV \\nstatus prior to prenatal screening. Only one  of the 111 infants born to HIV -positive mothers w as HIV i nfected; the \\nmother did not seek prenatal care [8].  \\nIn the US A, a significant reduction of perinatal HIV infections was achieved by routine HIV screening of pregnant \\nwomen and by MTCT prevention measures; in 1991, an estimated 1  650 perinatal infec tions was reported; in 2002, \\nthe numbers were down to between 144 and 236. In 2001,  the US Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention \\nrecommended a routine second HIV test during the third trimester for women with an  elevated risk for HIV \\ninfection because some regions showed an  increasing proportion of MTCT in women who had tested HIV negative \\nearlier in pregnancy [9].   \\nIn New York State, the outcome  of an MTCT prevention scheme (1988–2008) was assessed based on surveillance, \\nlaboratory and programme monitoring data. In 1997, only half of the women received prenatal testing. Since 2002, \\nat least 95% of pregnant women have been tested. The rate of MTCT declined significantly in the same period of \\ntime: 11.5% in 1997 ve rsus 1.3% in 2008. MTCT was more likely in the infants of  mothers diagnosed with HIV at \\nor after delivery than in those whose mothers were diagnosed earlier and in infants whose mothers did not receive \\nany prenatal care [10]. US data on HIV -exposed singlet on deliveries in 1996 –2000 were used to study missed \\nopportunities for perinatal HIV prevention.  Two major missed opportunities were observed: lack of prenatal care \\nand lack of prenatal HIV diagnosis despite prenatal care [11].  \\nIn a study in North Carolina  conducted between  November 2002  and April 2005 , HIV RNA testing was used for all \\nwomen who were antibody negative  at the time of r outine testing in order to determine the prevalence of acute \\n(antibody -negative ) HIV infection in pregnant women. A total of 0.2% of women tested positive, 3.4% of them had \\nacute HIV infections. One -third of the women with acute HIV infection were pregnant. During the study period, six \\nHIV-infected infants were reported ; three were born to women who were  antibody negative between 12 and \\n18 weeks of gestation [12].  \\nEight studies [13 -23] compared the performance of several antenatal HIV screening strategies/policies in relation \\nto achieved coverage of screening programmes. Generally, a  universal testing approach with opt -out strategy was \\nconsidered to be the most effective. However, some regions achieve d high testing rates among  pregnant women \\nby using an opt -in strategy.  \\nIn Denmark, the effectiveness of selective HIV screening fo r the prevention of MTCT was studied. In 1997, it was \\nrecommended that women in high -risk groups should be offered HIV testing during pregnancy. In 2000 –2001, \\nthree infants born to mother s in high -risk groups were vertically infected  – none of the mothers were offered an \\nHIV test  during pregnancy. It was concluded that selective screening for HIV during pregnancy was ineffective and \\nshould be replaced by a universal offer of HIV testing [19].  \\nA Dutch study compared two antenatal HIV screening  strategies: non-selective opt -out and selective opt -in. HIV-\\ninfected pregnant women were retrospectively identified from the Dutch HIV cohort 2000 –2008 data ; HIV-positive \\ninfants were identified through  a questionnaire distributed to paediatric HIV centres. In 2004 , the selective opt -in \\nantenatal HIV screening strategy was replaced by a non -selective opt -out strategy. Opt -out screening in \\ncombination  with prevention interventions appeared to detect more HIV  infections in pregnant  women and reduce d \\nMTCT substantially : before 2004 , only 33% of all HIV-infected pregnant women were diagnosed , while after \\nJanuary 2004, 80% were diagnosed . No HIV -infected children were born to the HIV -infected women whose \\ninfection was known before pregnancy or after t he first-trimester screenin g [13].  \\nA study conducted in the UK analysed the effectiveness of universal antenatal screening  to reach the HIV -infected \\npregnant women. Universal antenatal screening was introduced in England in 1999. In Scotland, some regions had \\na policy of universal testing before 2003, and in mid -2003, the remaining regions implemented testing. The data \\ndemonstrated that the universal offering has improved detection rates both in England and Scotland. In England, \\nan estimated 12% of women remained undiagnosed at deli very in 2003 compared with 26% in 2000. In Scotland, \\n11% of women remained undiagnosed at delivery in 2004 compared with 32% in 2000. The Scottish data revealed \\nthat an increasing proportion of women were having their infection diagnosed antenatally [17].  \\nIn Catalonia, Spain, where a policy of universal offer of HIV testing for pregnant women has been  implemented \\nsince 1996, medical records showed an HIV testing uptake rate  of 88.3% in 2000 (94% in public and 71% in \\nprivate hospitals). Study data  show that  prenatal HIV testing was frequently not documented in medical records \\nand that 10% of women were unaware that they had been  tested ; for 7.2% of the women who reported HIV \\ntesting, this information was not found in the medical records. The main reason for n ot having had an HIV test was \\nnot having been offered the test (65%) [20].   \\nA study conducted in the US A and Canada compared three different prenatal HIV -antibody testing approaches: \\nopt-in, opt -out voluntary testing of pregnant women , and mandatory newborn testing (the newborns are tested for  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n10 HIV with or without mother’s consent if the mother ’s HIV status is unknown at delivery). Testing rates among \\nwomen who gave birth  varied depending on the approach: opt -out voluntary testing and ma ndatory testing of \\nnewborns were associated with the highest testing rates. In regions using an opt-in approach , testing rates varied \\nbetween  25% and 81%, while regions using an opt-out policy reported  rates between  71% and 98%. Shifting from \\nan opt -in app roach to either opt -out or mandatory newborn testing increased prenatal HIV -testing rates [14]. In \\nCalifornia , a 1996 law mandate s prenatal care providers to offer HIV test s to all pregnant woman. Data from \\npopulation -based surveillance of 496 HIV -infected  women and their infants, collected between  1987 and 2002, \\nwere analysed to compare the change in H IV test  offers before and after 1996. Unsurprisingly, t here was a \\nsignificant increase in HIV test offers  for the period 1996−2002 : between  1987 and 1995, 53.2% of women giving \\nbirth were offered an HIV test; between 1996 and 2002, the rate had climbed to 84.2% . All in all, 96.9% of \\nwomen with unknown HIV status accepted the HIV test [23].  \\nA study conducted in Ontario, Canada by Remis et al., showed that by implementing a policy to offer HIV \\ncounselling  and testing to all pregnant women in 1999, increased the testing rate from 33% in 1999 to 96% in \\n2010. The policy recom mended an opt-in approach − HIV testing carried out with pre -test counsel ling and \\ninformed consent [22]. The Canadian  province of Alberta  uses an  opt-out strategy for prenatal HIV screening. in \\n2002–2004, serum samples from women who opted -out were serologically tested for HIV. The proportion of \\nspecimens from women who opted o ut of prenatal HIV testing was low and decreased from 4.3% in 2002 to 3.6% \\nin 2004. HIV seroprevalence among specimens from women who opted out was, however, 3.3 times higher than \\nthe HIV seroprevalence among specimens from women who opted -in during the st udy period [21].  \\nA Canadian study by Dorval et al. among women attending antenatal care clinics in 2005, recruited prior to their \\nfirst antenatal appointment, focused on how knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV and antenatal HIV screening \\ninfluence scree ning rates. Most women  (92%) supported universal HIV screening in the prenatal period; 72 % \\nagreed with an opt-out policy , and 24 % preferred to opt -in. Women accepting prenatal HIV screening were more \\nlikely to be aware of the benefits of screening to reduc e the MTCT rate [15].  \\nA French study by Jasseron et al. investigated whether MTCT management and rate differed between African \\nimmigrants and French -born HIV type 1 -infected women who gave birth  in France in 1984 –2007. The proportion of \\nAfrican mothers among HIV type 1 -infected pregnancies increased from 11.8% in 1984 –1986 to 45.4% in 1996 –\\n1998 and 64.0% in 2002 –2004. A higher percentage of African women (40.6% ) discovered their infection during \\npregnancy than  French -born mothers  (11.5% ); 7.6% of the Afr ican women started antiretroviral  therapy after 32 \\nweeks gestation (versus 4.1%  in French -born pregnant women ). Late treatment initiation was associated with late \\naccess to HIV diagnosis and prenatal care. The overall MTCT rate among mothers receiving antiretroviral therapy  \\nduring pregnancy was 1.5% in 1997 –2004. The rate was higher in African (1.8%) than French -born women \\n(0.8%) [18].  \\nData collected in Italy by Floridia et al. in 2001 –2006 also indicated that foreign -born women were less likely to be \\naware of being HIV -infected before pregnancy ( 87.6%  versus 52.1%); they also  start antiretroviral treatment later  \\n(week 14 versus week 7) than women of Italian nationality. Seven cases of MTCT were observed (rate: 1.9%). The \\ntwo cases in non-Italian women included one woman who was diagnosed after delivery and one woman diagnosed \\nat delivery. The five cases in Italian women included four women who received treatment  with a ntiretroviral drugs  \\nduring pregnancy and one woman who receiv ed intra -partum tre atment only [16]. The authors pointed out  the \\nneed for specific interventions to increase counselling and HIV testing rates in foreign women before they become \\npregnant .  \\n3.2.2 Cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for  HIV \\nThree cost -effectiveness anal yses from the 2000s were identified (Table 1).  \\nThe c ost-effectiveness of universal antenatal screening depends directly on  the prevalence of HIV infection.  In a \\n2008 study, universal screening in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, was considered cost-effective i f the prevalence \\nwas equal to, or higher than , 14 cases per 100 000  population  [24]; for Australia , prevalence for cost -effectiveness  \\nwas needed to be at 4.37 cases per 100 000  population to reach c ost-effectiveness  [25]. A study from  New \\nZealand cited the willingness of policy makers  to pay for an additional life -year gained as an influence on decision s \\nwith regard to  universal or selective screening  [26].  \\nIn the Dutch study mentioned above,  universal screening for HIV infection s during pregnancy  was compared to no t \\noffering  screening at all [24]. The analysis was done from a healthcare  perspective . The study  estimated life years \\ngained (LYG) by avoiding infections in children , as well as the costs associated with screening and lifetime medical \\ncosts of HIV -infected children. The study found systematic screening to be cost -effective as compared with no \\nscreening all, based on a willingness -to-pay threshold value of 20 000 EUR/LYG if the prevalence of HIV -infected \\npregnant women was at least 14 cases per 100 000  population . The authors concluded that universal HIV \\nscreening during pregnancy in Amsterdam was justified and generate d significant net cost savings and health \\nbenefits in most situations.   TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  11 In a 2004 Australia n study , universal HIV scree ning during pregnancy was compared with the then-current practice \\nof testing only if the pregnant woman explicitly asked to be tested or was considered  to be at high risk [25]. The \\ncost-effectiveness of systematic screening was assessed by looking at the  likelihood of HIV infection among those \\nnot screened. The study estimated additional life years  gained by mothers and children , the costs associated with \\nscreening , and the lifetime medical costs for HIV -infected children. The value of one additional year o f life was \\ndefined as the average income per capita multiplied by two. Also taken into account were t he costs of an earlier \\ninitiation of treatment for infected mothers and children and training costs for healthcare  personnel. Universal HIV \\nscreening was e stimated to be cost -effective in Australia if the prevalence of HIV infection among unscreened \\npopulations was between 0.0016% and 0.0106%. The authors concluded that universal screening would be cost -\\neffective at a very low prevalence and would generate measurable benefits . They also  highlighted the need for \\naccurate statistics on prevalence.  \\nAn analysis from a healthcare point of view  compared universal HIV screening of pregnant women  in New Zealand  \\nwith screening based on risk assessment [26]. In the analysis, treatment costs for mothers and children were \\nincluded ‘for a defined period after birth to a point when it was assumed that both mothers and babies would have \\nbeen identified regardless of a universal screening programme ’ [26].  \\nThe additional life years  gained by infected mothers with earlier initiation of treatment were also taken into \\naccount. The results of this analysis compared favourably with cost -estimates per life year gained from simi lar \\nstudies in other developed countries as well as to other healthcare  interventions in New Zealand. The main factor \\naffecting the decision of whether to implement universal screening program mes in New Zealand was HIV \\nprevalence in addition to the policy makers’ willingness to pay for an additional life -year gained.  \\nTable 1.

A further three articles \\ncontained effectiven ess data.  \\nThe effectiveness of antenatal screening for the prevention of hepatitis B vertical transmission was shown to \\ndepend on the prevalence of infection and the level of maternal viral load among pregnant women, as well as the \\ncoverage of the screeni ng programme.  \\nThe effectiveness of antenatal screening for the prevention of perinatally transmitted HBV infection was assessed in \\nsix Italian regions in 2001. It was shown that 95% of all newborns of HBsAg -positive  mothers were given active \\nand passive i mmunisation; all newborns  from foreign mothers  received active and passive immunisation . The \\nintroduction of compulsory antenatal HBsAg screening for pregnant women led to vastly  improved screening  \\nadherence. Three factors were observed to predict lack of compliance with screening: large family size, birth in a \\nprivate hospital , and immigration from a developing country. Pregnant women from foreign countries with high \\nHBsAg carrier rates were shown to be two  times  less likely to adhere to HBsAg screening th an Italian women. \\nSupplementary efforts were suggested to improve the effectiveness of the programme among foreign -born \\nwomen  [27].  \\nAnother Italian study evaluated compliance with a protocol for  the prevention of perinatal hepatitis B infection in \\npublic and private hospitals of 13 Italian regions  between 2008 and 2009. Prevalence of HBsAg among pregnant \\nwomen varied between 0.4% (Italian -born women ) and 3.44% (women born in e astern Europe ); overall \\nprevalence was 0.86%. Nearly 98% of pregnant women were screened and 100% of newborns from HBsAg -\\npositive mothers received immunoprophylaxis at birth. Giving birth  in a public hospital or in hospitals located in \\nsouthern Italy and being of foreign nationality  were predic tors of not being screened [28].  \\nIn Denmark , selective screening missed 30 –50% of pregnant women in high -risk groups while opt -out screening \\n(introduc ed in 2005 ) led to a vaccination coverage of 96% among newborns of HBsAg -positive  mothers, twice as \\nhigh a s before . The prevalence of hepatitis B in this study was 0.012% among women of Danish origin and 2.74% \\namong foreign -born women. General screening prevented 8.4% cases of mother -to-child transmissions among \\nnewborns from mothers who carried the hepatitis B virus  [29]. \\nA study from Ireland found that the uptake of hepatitis B screening was excellent : 99.98% of women presenting \\nfor antenatal care accepted hepatitis B screening. Screening revealed that in 87% of cases the HBV carrier status \\nwas previously unk nown. The cost of screening equated GBP 1 013 per new diagnosis , which was considered to be \\nhighly cost -effective considering the  morbidity and mortality associated with vertically transmitted hepatitis B. \\nSelective screening would have missed a significan t number of those infected. Opt -out screening was concluded to \\nbe more appropriate than selective  screening , with the added advantage of being equitable and easy to \\nimplement  [30]. \\nIn Greece , the reasons for not complying with universal prenatal testing of HBsAg were studied as there were \\nconcerns that women with a higher disease burden may escape screening. Universal mass vaccination combined \\nwith improvements in socioeconomic and sanitary co nditions, as well as screening of blood donors, led to a  TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  13 significant decrease in HBV prevalence. A large influx  of immigrant s led to a shift in the epidemiology , with \\nimmigrant women compris ing almost 20% of the child -bearing population in Greece. The overall screening rate \\nwas 91.3% in a nationwide study ; a hospital in Athens serving a large population of refugees  reported a rate of \\n89.4%. Pregnant  women who escaped hepatitis B screening were more likely to be chronically infected, deliver in a \\npublic hosp ital, and be classified as ‘ illiterate immigrants ’. It was concluded that stepped -up surveillance, \\nimmunisation programmes , and better access to routine screening was needed to effectively prevent MTCT among \\nimmigrant mothers [31].  \\nNorway is classified as a low -prevalence country for hepatitis B infection ; the prevalence of hepatitis B in pregnant \\nwomen is 0.1%. Vaccination is targeted primarily at  risk groups. National guidelines recommend the screening of \\nimmigrant s from high -prevalence countries, particu larly asylum seekers, but also  children adopted from abroad. \\nData regarding the uptake of testing and vaccination among these populations  are limited . The percentage of \\nmother -to-child transmission of registered routes of transmission was shown to be 0.2%. It was concluded that \\nuniversal screening should be introduced and that a universal vaccination strategy should be considered, given the \\nhigh cost o f reaching the target populations. The authors also recommend  that the surveillance system for hepatitis \\nB should be evaluated. In addition, screening effectiveness  should be assessed and immigrant populations should \\nreceive vaccinations  [32]. \\nSince 1989 , the Netherlands has screened all pregnant women for HBsAg at their first visit to the obstetrician, \\nmidwife or GP. A study from Amsterdam, where hepatitis B prevalence is higher than in the rest of the Netherlands, \\nfound an increase of 91% to 97% in antena tal screening coverage during 1993 –1998.  The rate of HBsAg positivity \\nwas lowest (0.07%) among pregnant women from the Netherlands Antilles, low (0.07%) among native Dutch \\nwomen , and highest (8.9%) among women from Ghana. The Amsterdam  enhanced screening p rogramme was \\nconsidered cheap and effective and was used to monitor the impact of neonatal immuni sation. The programme \\nincluded the analysis  of samples  in the public health laboratory , which then informed the municipal health services  \\nif HBsAg -positive  mothers needed  confirmatory testing. The e xpected delivery date was recorded  in a computer ised \\nsystem , and a public health nurse made sure that  hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) was available.  Within a week \\nthe public health nurse verified that HBIG was given and arranged for the first dose of vaccine to be administered \\nat home or in the  hospital; the second dose of vaccine was administered at a municipal health services  site [33]. It \\nwas sugges ted that contact tracing and the vaccination of contacts of HBsAg -positive  women should be integrated \\ninto the hepatitis B antenatal screening programme after encouraging results in reducing the pool of infective \\nindividuals among older children and adults  [34]. In 2008 , the antenatal HBsAg prevalence for the Netherlands was \\n0.33% , with 99.2% of the HBsAg -positive  women being long -term carriers . The m ost frequently reported regions \\nof origin were Asia (38%) and sub -Saharan Africa (23%). Due to antenatal scr eening , an estimated number of 50  \\nto 75 HBV infections in newborns could be  prevented annually [7]. \\n3.3.2 Cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for  hepatitis B  \\nThe literature search identified t hree cost -effectiveness analyses from the 1990s on hepati tis B screening (Table 2).  \\nTwo studies  were from an UK healthcare  perspective . Prevalence rang ed from 0.083 % to 1.3% . The studies \\ncompared universal screening of pregnant women with screening based on risk mapping [35,36]. Both concluded \\nthat the cost-effectiveness of universal screening was at an acceptable level  and recommended that screening  \\nshould be introduced . The s tudies highlighted that limiting screening to high -risk groups would lea ve a number of \\nmaternal infections undetected and  lead to  the infection of  children. The most important assumptions that affected \\nthe results of the sensitivity analyses were infection prevalence, the cost of screening tests , and the likelihood of \\ntransmission.  \\nA study from the Belgian healthcare  perspective com pared universal screening with no screening at all. P revalence \\nat the time of the study was 0.67% . [37]. The cost -effectiveness of universal screening was comparable to other \\ngenerally accepted medical procedures. Screening all pregnant women and vaccinati ng all neonates at risk was not \\nconsidered cost -saving. The main assumptions influencing the results of the sensitivity analyses were the \\nprevalence of infection, screening and vaccination costs, and discount rate.

TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  15 3.4 Syphilis  \\n3.4.1 Effectiveness of antenatal screening for  syphilis  \\nThe literature search did not identify any comparative studies on the effectiveness of antenatal screening for  \\nsyphilis , but five articles reporting on the effectiveness of syphilis screening were identified. A further five articles \\nwere include d from other searches. Screening proved to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e. stillbirth and \\nperinatal death) and although  women from country -specific high -risk groups were found to be affected by higher \\nrates of syphilis during pregnancy, a universal  antenatal screening policy was considered effective and ethically \\nappropriate.  \\nA 2006 study from the  United Kingdom cited three major risk factors for infectious syphilis in pregnant women \\nincluded: living in London and the South East, belonging to an et hnic minority group , and having been born \\nabroad. Antenatal screening was performed  routine ly, but there were no national data on the number of cases of \\nsyphilis diagnosed during  pregnancy ; also lacking were data  on the rate of congenital syphilis.  The stu dy called  for \\nrobust national surveillance of syphilis in pregnan t women and the identification and recording of  cases of \\ncongenital syphilis [38].  \\nIn the United States, syphilis was found to be most common in non-white women below  30 years of age , with little \\neducation and low income. Women with syphilis were more likely to have late or no prenatal care. Women at high \\nrisk or in high -prevalence areas were recommended to be screened a second time in the third trimester [39].  \\nAn Austrian study d ocument ed the development of syphilis and analyse d the effectiveness of antenatal syphilis \\nscreening practices  in Austria . In Austria, the i ncidence of syphilis had declined , and the geographical variation was \\nlarge. In metropolitan Vienna, the incidence was 12 time s higher than in the federal provinces , which are mainly  \\nrural in character. The cost of screening in rural areas was four times higher than the potential savings . \\nCalculations suggest ed that universal syphilis screening in pregnancy was not justified. The authors recommended \\nthat consideration should be given to replace general screening with targeted screening for high-risk groups  [40].  \\nIn a 2011 systematic review of literature, three outcomes were assessed to examine evidence for  the effectiveness \\nof interventions: increased uptake of syphilis testing, increased treatment rates , and reduction in adverse \\npregnancy outcomes. Ten studies with interventions to improve outcomes of antenatal syphilis screening  were \\nincluded . The studies did not allow for the assessment of the ideal time for syphilis screening. The  included studies \\ndid not provide sufficient information on the outcomes of partner treatment ; also lacking was sufficient information \\non repeat screening s during  the third trimester to reduce the risk of reinfection. Delayed treatment of syphilis in \\npregnancy increased the likelihood of congenital syphilis. Screening was found to reduce adverse pregnancy \\noutcomes, particularly rates of stillbirth and perinatal death [41]. \\nIn Switzerland , antenatal screening for syphilis was not generally recommended; it was discontinued during the \\n1990s. Notifiability of syphilis infections was restored in 1999 due to increasing incidence rate s. From 2006 to \\n2009, infectious syphil is cases in women of childbearing age  increase d substantially . Improvement s in prenatal care \\nand syphilis programmes ware recommended [42].  \\nA WHO analysis of global and regional estimates of syphilis in pregnancy and adverse outcomes was performed for \\n2008 data. Syphilis seropositivity among antenatal care attendees in Europe was reported to be 0.16% . The \\nanalysis included only a few countries for which data reported through the HIV Universal Access system  were \\navailable . It was recommended that all countri es should collect data on at least three indicators of MTCT of \\nsyphilis: proportion of antenatal care attendees that are tested for syphilis, proportion of seropositive attendees, \\nand proportion of seropositives that are adequately treated. It was conclude d that all countries should scale up the \\nscreening and treatment for syphilis in pregnancy [43].  \\nIn 1999, the  compulsory notification of syphilis came to an end in the Netherlands . Since then there had been no \\nnationwide registration system for the monitor ing of congenital syphilis. Acceptance of syphilis screening tests was \\nhigh; tests were only refused between one and four  times a year. Congenital syphilis was diagnosed in fewer than \\nfive newborns per year ; in all cases the mothers belonged to vulnerable groups (illegal immigrants or drug users). \\nIt was estimated that 10 cases of syphilis in newborns were prevented by screening. Universal screening was \\nconsidered simpler and more acceptable than a programme only focused on risk groups [7].  \\nA prospective It alian study from 2006 –2007 found the maternal syphilis seroprevalence at delivery to be 0.17%. \\nMost seropositive mothers were born outside Italy, but foreign origin was not associated with a worse neonatal \\noutcome. Congenital syphilis was diagnosed in 20/1 00 000 live births. Maternal risk factors included young age \\n(<20), no antenatal care , and no adequate treatment. The authors did not observe any  association with marital \\nstatus, unemployment, previous syphilis diagnosis or coexistence of other maternal infections. The majority of \\ninfants born to seropositive mothers was delivered in northern Italian hospitals from immigrant mothers mostly \\nfrom eastern Europe. A total of 25% of Itali an mothers had no antenatal syphilis screening versus 12% of \\nimmigrant women [44].   Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n16 In a UK study from the late 1990s, switching to target ed surveillance or even stopping antenatal screening for  \\nsyphilis was observed to save relatively little money. Three groups of pregnant women were identified as potentia l \\ntarget groups : pregnant women in the Thames region, women belonging to non-white ethnic groups , and women  \\nborn outside the United Kingdom. Selective screening by country of birth or ethnic group would d etect at least \\n70% of cases ; targeting by region would also be effective , but u p to 30% of cases would still be missed. In \\naddition, selective screening would cause ethical and medico -legal problems and be politically and practically \\ndifficult. Medico -legal costs could be associated with failure to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths and illness resulting \\nfrom congenital infection because of missed cases. Targeted screening runs the risk of missing newly developing \\nrisk groups and unexpected increases  in transmission [45].  \\nIn an article  without primary data, the authors advocated a priority listing for scaling up control over sexually \\ntransmitted infections other than HIV/AIDS . The strengthening of p artner notification s was also considered \\nnecessary , which wo uld improve  case finding, would prevent re -infection from an existing partner , and could \\ninterrupt the onward transmission in a sexual network [46].  \\n3.4.2 Cost -effectiveness of antenatal syphilis screening  \\nTwo cost -effectiveness analyses were identified for the syphilis review (Table 3).  \\nA literature search on economic evaluations of syphilis screening  retrieved  a cost -effectiveness analysis from a \\nhealthcare perspective  (late 1990 s, United Kingdom ) [45] an d a cost–benefit  analysis using the societal point of \\nview from (early 1980s , Norway [47] (Table 3). Both recommended that syphilis screening in early pregnancy \\nshould be continued.  \\nThe UK study [45] compared systematic screening for syphilis in early pre gnancy to other more limited screening \\noptions. The consequences of infection transmission to the child (impact on life expectancy, treatment and other \\ncosts) were not estimated. The study found that direct costs for the limited screening options were lower, but only \\n70 to 77% of infected mothers would be identified , i.e. several children would be infected each year. Limiting \\nscreening would also bring ethical, legal, practical and political problems. For these reasons and due to the \\nchanging international syphilis prevalence, it was recommended that systematic screening during pregnancy  should \\nbe implemented .  \\nIn the Norwegian study [47], systematic screening for syphilis in early pregnancy was compared to no screening  at \\nall. Screening was estimated to ave rt costs caused by infections in children  (i.e. treatment, special education, \\nresidential care and loss of earnings), and the achieved cost savings were almost four times higher than the costs \\nincurred by the yearly screening program me. Continuation of the  screening was recommended.  \\nA WHO study modelling the costs and cost -effectiveness of screening and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy \\nwas published when this report was almost  finalised. It modelled screening in eight generic country scenarios and \\nconclude d that congenital syphilis could be eliminated through an expanded screening and treatment program me \\nin antenatal care facilities . This would be cost saving in high -prevalence settings where prevalence of a reactive \\nsyphilis serological test in pregnancy is 3%. In the low -prevalence scenarios , the cost per DALY (disability -adjusted \\nlife year ) averted ranged from USD 24 to USD 111; the authors conclude d that according to the WHO standards \\nthis would be cost -effective  [48].

However, seven descriptive studies concerning the effectiveness of rubella susceptibility \\nscreening were identified.  \\nIn some countries with high vaccination coverage and low rubella incidence, antenatal screening  of rubella \\nsusceptibility has been discontinued. However, subnational areas and risk groups remain where antenatal screening \\nfor rubella susceptibility is still considered necess ary [49].   \\nThree UK studies assess ed the  effectiveness of rubella susceptibility screening. In a study from London, a high \\nscreening rate of over 90% for rubella susceptibility was found , with an overall rubella susceptibility of 3.6%. \\nHowever, in some are as of London the susceptibility rates were considerably higher (14.3%), which was \\nunderstood to reflect the ethnic diversity of these areas [50]. In a study conducted by the National Health Service \\n(NHS) Blood and Transplant , a large number of samples from antenatal women  was screened during routine \\nchecks. The NHS study  identified two predictors of low levels of rubella antibodies : birth cohorts born after 1990 \\nand ethnicity  [51]. A significant increase in those with low leve ls of rubella antibodies (< 10IU/ml) was observed in \\nanother UK study.  A changing pattern of rubella seronegativity and susceptibility in pregnant women born before \\nand after 1983 was observed. It was found difficult to obtain accurate figures for uptake f or postpartum \\nimmun isation rates because there was no requirement to notify adult measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) \\nvaccinations to a recording authority [52].  \\nIn Ireland , researchers  concluded that  in order  to prevent congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) heal th services \\nshould focus on women who are young, nulliparous , and born outside the EU. The increased rate of rubella \\nseronegativity in the general population in 2009 was associated with an increase in migration. The study also found \\nthat it would be cost -effective to focus screening on this easily identifiable group. Also , vaccinations without \\nserological testing for women from countries without rubella programmes could be cost -effective [53].   Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n18 In a Canadian study from Quebec,  in-hospital postpartum vaccinat ion was found to be an effective means of \\nvaccinating groups at risk. Misconceptions about vaccine use were noted that affected timely administration and \\nled to missed opportunities [54].  \\nIn Italy , free serological testing for rubella susceptibility has b een part of the standard pregnancy care since 1995. \\nA study on congenital infections from the Campania region found that no s ystematic process and outcome \\nmonitoring was implemented . Standard s of care were unequal , possibly excluding low -income pregnant wo men \\nwith poor or no antenatal care. The dramatic rise in congenital rubella and rubella incidence during pregnancy in \\n2008 might have been a consequence of the vaccination campaigns for children in 2004 –2007 that were carried \\nout without  conducting  a catch -up campaign to vaccinate susceptible women of childbearing age. Congenital \\nrubella was found to be an issue since all but one case were found in native -born mothers.  Actions to reduce the \\ngap between children and adult vaccination coverage were recommended [55]. The goals of the National Program \\nto Eradicate Measles and Congenital Rubella (PNEM) in Italy were to reduce and limit the occurrence of CRS to less \\nthan one case per 100  000 live births ( fewer  than five cases per year), to reach 95% vacc ination coverage in \\npaediatric age , and to have less than 5% of pregnant women susceptible to rubella. The proportion of women \\nfound to be at risk of rubella infection was 14.2%. The highest risk rate was found in women in the 15 –25-year-old \\ngroup (24.7%) ; 33.8% of susceptible women had been pregnant at least once before. Vaccination was \\nrecommended to be performed before discharge. A high proportion of women was observed to be unaware of the \\nrisk posed by rubella infection during pregnancy (36%) [56].  \\n3.5.2 Cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for  rubella \\nsusceptibility  \\nOnly one cost -effectiveness analysis about rubella susceptibility screening was identified in the literature search \\n(Table 4).  \\nThe Dutch cost -utility analysis from 2010 [49] compared s creening non -vaccinated pregnant women in the low-\\nvaccination -coverage regions (LVR), screening all pregnant women in LVR , and screening all non -vaccinated \\npregnant women in the country. The calculations were based on the 2004 –2005 rubella epidemic in the \\nNetherlands, and costs were calculated separately for epidemic and non -epidemic years. Screening pregnant \\nwomen for rubella antibodies was found cost -effective if targeted at unvaccinated women in LVR in the \\nNetherlands. Screening all pregnant women in LVR  or screening all non -vaccinated pregnant women in the \\nNetherlands was cost-effective if cost savings due to avoided treatment costs for prevented complications were \\nlifelong.  \\nTable 4.

TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  19 The three studies on the cost -effectiveness of HIV screening [24 -26] were of high quality (Table 5). They fulfilled \\nall [24], 9/10 [25] or 8/10 [26] of the 10 criteria for program me cost-effectiveness studies  (see Drummond and \\nJefferson [2] ). The description of the comparator (ordinary c are) was not described in full detail in the two latter \\nstudies  [24,25] , and Bramley et al. [26] had not reported capital costs of the program me. These omissions were \\njudged not to impact on the validity of the conclusions.  \\nCost-effectiveness studies on s creening for hepatitis B [35 -37] were of high quality, fulfilling at least 7 of the 10 \\nDrummond criteria [2] (Table 5). None of the studies discussed general isability with regard to  other settings or \\npresented an incremental analysis, and only one [37] use d discounting in presenting the effects. These omissions \\nwere judged not to impact on the validity of the conclusions.  Two of the cost -effectiveness studies [45,48] fulfilled \\nall Drummond criteria and were thus of high quality (Table 5). Stray -Pedersen [47 ] failed to conduct incremental \\nand sensitivity analyses, and the conclusions were based on calculated net benefit rather than cost –effectiveness \\nratio, but the quality of the study was still  considered to be high.  \\nThe cost –utility study on rubella suscept ibility screening  fulfilled all Drummond criteria [2] (Table 5).  \\nTable 5.

In addition to these factors, cost -\\neffectiveness is influenced by the prevalence of these infections among pregnant women, the cost of the screening \\nprogram me, and the practice/policy that the screening is compared with. Program me costs depend mainly of the \\ncost of administering  and analysing the screening /confirmatory tests, the type of healthcare  personnel and their \\ntime, cost of medication and other necessary treatment, and patient compliance.  \\nCoverage and compliance with a un iversal screening policy can be enhanced by increasing the level of awareness \\nthrough  public information ; enhancing provider awareness ; improved  access to testing, treatment and follow -up; \\nand allocation of adequate resources [55]. Screening is usually only provided once  (in the early stages  of \\npregnancy ). A second screening late during the  pregnancy is highly unlikely to be cost -effective , especially in \\ncountries with relatively low incidence of HIV, HBV and syphilis. In general , universal screening is con sidered \\nsimpler and more acceptable than a programme which  focuse s on risk groups [7].   \\n4.1 Limitations  \\nThe literature review for effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening  was limited to publications in \\nEnglish or Nordic languages. Overa ll linguistic bias was low as  only 29  (3%) of the 981 identified publications were \\nexcluded because of  language restrictions. References to documents in other languages were preserved  (but are \\nnot yet translated)  in the source material  for this project for potential future use.  \\nThe literature review on the cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening found relatively few relevant articles ( three \\non HIV, three on hepatitis B, two on  syphilis and one for rubella susceptibility). This emphas ises the fact that  \\nantenatal screening for  infectious diseases has rarely been  assessed for cost effectiveness in an evidence -based \\nmanner . It also shows the need for an assessment of the existing practices. The scope of the literature search was \\nbroadened  because the autho rs of this report felt that making  recommendations based on only nine articles (and \\ndata collected from the survey) was inadequate. This allowed for the review  of cost-independent factors of \\neffectiveness at the operational level. The expanded search resul ted in the inclusion of 19 additional articles on \\nHIV, six on  hepatitis B, five on  syphilis and seven  on rubella susceptibility screening , which provided helpful \\nbackground information for the development of  a future guidance  document .  \\nLiterature review s depend on the quality of search strategies and on the ability to identify  all relevant articles that \\naddress the questions under review. Screening the search results for relevance always involves a degree of \\nsubjectiv ity, even when performed in accordance  with predefined inclusion criteria. The selection of articles \\nfollowed predefined steps and was always carried out  by two persons who initially worked independently. Several \\nsearch strategies were tested in the various databases, and  the final search strategies were decided upon when no \\nadditional significant publications could be  retrieved  by further modification s to the algorithms.  \\nIt was particularly difficult for the project to comprehensively identify grey literature (reports and other types of \\npublic ations not indexed in databases) , even i f published in  English or one of the Nordic languages. Ancestry \\nsearches were used to identify such materials . Although this approach provide d a few additional publications , it is \\nlikely that some relevant materials may have been missed .  \\n   Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal scre ening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility   TECHNICAL REPORT  \\n22 5 Conclusions  \\nWith regard to  HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis, most studies suggest that comprehensive , population -based antenatal \\nscreening is cost -effective in all European settings where this has been researched . \\nIn the end, any judgement on cost effectiveness will be  a value judgement. Judging whether a preventive \\nprogramme is cost -effective is highly dependent on the thresholds set for the cost per life years  (or other health \\nmetric s used) that can be saved, unless it can be sho wn that the programme actually is saving  costs. This figure \\n(which describes how much has to be invested in a  program/intervention per year and for every  life year  saved) \\nwill vary between countries , depending on multiple factors that cannot be determined by any other authority than \\nnational policymakers  because every country needs to prioritise its health investments in accordance with national \\nneeds. What is considered as ‘t olerable costs ’ varies widely in Europe and can be somewhere between thousands \\nand hundreds of thousands of euros per life year saved. In addition, comparisons of costs and cost -effectiveness \\nthresholds are notoriously difficult  between countries and systems, if not impossible, due to t he heterogen eity of \\nhealthcare  systems and the diff erent approaches employed in the antenatal screening for infections.  \\nThe effectiveness of antenatal screening depends on the coverage of the screening program me, the quality of \\ntesting, and the effectiveness of treatment. The ability to reach all pregnant women, the sensitivity of the \\nscreening test (i.e. the  capacity to identify all infected women ), and the preventi ve treatment received by all \\ninfected pregnant women are factors that influence  effectiveness.  \\nIn order to assess the  performance (effectiveness) of antenatal screening for infections, it is essential to have \\ncomprehensive surveillance systems in place that accurate ly record prevention failures (i.e. the transmission of HIV, \\nhepatitis B, syphilis or rubella from the moth er to the child) and document  the targets  and indicators of all \\nscreening programme s. Ideally, surveillance  systems record information from infected mothers and their children \\n(in an attempt to identify risk factors for MTCT ), document MTCT rates, identify  targets and indicators , and point \\ntoward  opportunities for improvement of antenatal screening and care.  \\n6 Next steps  \\nThe results of this literature review will serve as a basis for an ECDC guidance document on strengthening \\nantenatal screening programme s in the EU/EEA Member States.  \\n   TECHNICAL REPORT  Effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of antenatal screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella susceptibility  \\n  23 References  \\n1.
